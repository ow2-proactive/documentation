== Create a First Predictive Solution

Suppose you need to predict houses prices based on this information (features) provided by the estate agency:

- *CRIM* per capita crime rate by town
- *ZN* proportion of residential lawd zoned for lots over 25000
- *INDUS* proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- *CHAS* Charles River dummy variable
- *NOX* nitric oxides concentration
- *RM* average number of rooms per dwelling
- *AGE* proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- *DIS* weighted distances to five Boston Employment centres
- *RAD* index of accessibility to radial highways
- *TAX* full-value property-tax rate per $10 000
- *PTRATIO* pupil-teacher ratio by town
- *B* 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
- *LSTAT* % lower status of the population
- *MDEV* Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000' s

Predicting houses prices is a complex problem, but we can simplify it a bit for this step-by-step example. We'll show you how you can easily create a predictive analytics solution using PML.

=== Manage the Canvas

To use PML, you need to add the *Machine Learning Bucket* as main catalog in the ProActive Studio. This bucket contains a set of generic tasks that enables you to upload and prepare data, train a model and test it.

A. Open +++<a class="studioUrl" href="/studio" target="_blank">ProActive Workflow Studio</a>+++ home page.

B. Create a new workflow.

C. Change palette preset to `Machine Learning`.

D. Click on `machine-learning` catalog and pin it open, and same for the `data-visualization` catalog.

E. Organize your canvas.

NOTE: Change palette preset allows the user to visualise different set of catalogs in the studio.Â 

image::manage_canvas.gif[100000,2000]

=== Upload Data

To upload data into the Workflow, you need to use a dataset stored in a CSV file.

A. Once dataset has been converted to *CSV* format, upload it into a cloud storage service for example https://aws.amazon.com/s3[Amazon S3^].
For this tutorial, we will use Boston house prices dataset available on this link:
https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/activeeon-public/datasets/boston-houses-prices.csv

B. Drag and drop the <<Import_Data>> task from the *machine-learning* bucket in the Machine Learning Open Studio.

C. Click on the task and click `General Parameters` in the left to change the default parameters of this task.

D. Put in *FILE_URL* variable the S3 link to upload your dataset.

E. Set the other parameters according to your dataset format.

This task uploads the data into the workflow that we can for model training and testing.

If you want to skip these steps, you can directly use the <<Load_Boston_Dataset>> Task by a simple drag and drop.

image::upload_data.gif[100000,2000]

=== Prepare Data

This step consists of preparing the data for the training and testing of the predictive model. So in this example, we will simply split our datset into two separate datasets: one for training and one for testing.

To do this, we use the <<Split_Data>> Task in the machine_learning bucket.

A. Drag and drop the <<Split_Data>> Task into the canvas, and connect it to the <<Import_Data>> or <<Load_Boston_Dataset>> Task.

B. By default, the ratio is 0.7 this means that 70% of the dataset will be used for training the model and 0.3 for testing it.

C. Click the <<Split_Data>> Task and set the *TRAIN_SIZE* variable to 0.6.

image::prepare_data.gif[100000,2000]

=== Train a Predictive Model

Using PML, you can easily create different ML models in a single experiment and compare their results. This type of experimentation helps you find the best solution for your problem.
You can also enrich the `machine-learning` bucket by adding new ML algorithms and publish or customize an existing task according to your requirements as the tasks are open source.

NOTE: To change the code of a task click on it and click the `Task Implementation`. You can also add new variables to a specific task.

In this step, we will create two different types of models and then compare their scores to decide which algorithm is most suitable to our problem. As the Boston dataset used for this example consists of predicting price of houses (continuous label). As such, we need to deal with a regression predictive problem.

To solve this problem, we have to choose a regression algorithm to train the predictive model. To see the available regression algorithms available on the PML, see *ML Regression* Section in the *machine-learning* bucket.

For this example, we will use <<Linear_Regression>> Task and <<Support_Vector_Regression>> Task.

A. Find the <<Linear_Regression>> Task and <<Support_Vector_Regression>> Task and drag them into the canvas.

B. Find the <<Train_Model>> Task and drag it twice into the canvas and set its LABEL_COLUMN variable to LABEL.

C. Connect the <<Split_Data>> Task to the two <<Train_Model>> Tasks in order to give it access to the training data. Connect then the <<Linear_Regression>> Task to the first <<Train_Model>> Task and <<Support_Vector_Regression>> to the second <<Train_Model>> Task.

D. To be able to download the model learned by each algorithm, drag two <<Download_Model>> Tasks and connect them to each <<Train_Model>> Task.

image::train_a_predictive_model.png[100000,2000]

=== Test the Predictive Model

To evaluate the two learned predictive models, we will use the testing data that was separated out by the <<Split_Data>> Task to score our trained models. We can then compare the results of the two models to see which generated better results.

A. Find the <<Predict_Model>> Task and drag and drop it twice into the canvas and set its LABEL_COLUMN variable to LABEL.

B. Connect the first <<Predict_Model>> Task to the <<Train_Model>> Task that is connected to <<Support_Vector_Regression>> Task.

C. Connect the second <<Predict_Model>> Task to the <<Train_Model>> Task that is connected to <<Linear_Regression>> Task.

D. Connect both <<Predict_Model>> Tasks to the <<Split_Data>> Task.

E. Find the <<Preview_Results>> Task in the ML bucket and drag and drop it twice into the canvas.

F. Connect each <<Preview_Results>> Task with <<Predict_Model>>.

image::test_the_predictive_model.png[100000,2000]

NOTE: if you have a pickled file (.pkl) containing a predictive model that you have learned using another platform, and you need to test it in the PML, you can load it using *Import_Model* Task.

=== Run the Experiment and Preview the Results

Now the workflow is completed, let's execute it by:

A. Click the *Execute* button on the menu to run the workflow.

B. Click the *Scheduling & Orchestration* button to track the workflow execution progress.

C. Click the Visualization tab and track the progress of your workflow execution (a green check mark appears on each Task when its execution is finished).

D. Visualize the output logs by clicking on the output tab and check the streaming check box.

E. Click the *Tasks* tab, select a *Preview_Results* task and click on the *Preview* tab, then click either on *Open in browser* to preview the results on your browser or on *Save as file* to download the results locally.

== Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)

The `auto-ml-optimization` bucket contains the `Distributed_Auto_ML` workflow that can be easily used to find the operating parameters for any system whose performance can be measured as a function of adjustable parameters.
It is an estimator that minimizes the posterior expected value of a loss function.
This bucket also comes with a set of workflows' examples that demonstrates how we can optimize mathematical functions, PML workflows and machine/deep learning algorithms from scripts using AutoML tuners.
In the following subsections, several tables represent the main variables that characterize the AutoML workflows.
In addition to the variables mentioned below, there is a set of generic variables that are common between all workflows
which can be found in the subsection <<AI Workflows Common Variables>>.

=== Distributed AutoML

The `Distributed_Auto_ML` workflow proposes six algorithms for distributed hyperparameters' optimization. The choice of the
sampling/search strategy depends strongly on the tackled problem.
`Distributed_Auto_ML` workflow comes with specific pipelines (parallel or sequential) and visualization tools
(https://github.com/fossasia/visdom[Visdom^] or https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/[TensorBoard^]) as described in the subsections below.

*How to define the search space:*

This subsection describes common building blocks to define a search space:

    - uniform: Uniform continuous distribution.
    - quantized_uniform: Uniform discrete distribution.
    - log: Logarithmic uniform continuous distribution.
    - quantized_log: Logarithmic uniform discrete distribution.
    - choice: Uniform choice distribution between non-numeric samples.

*Which tuner algorithm to choose?*

The choice of the tuner depends on the following aspects:

    - Time required to evaluate the model.
    - Number of hyperparameters to optimize.
    - Type of variable.
    - The size of the search space.

In the following, we briefly describe the different tuners proposed by the `Distributed_Auto_ML` workflow:

    - *Grid sampling* applies when all variables are discrete, and the number of possibilities is low.
      A grid search is a naive approach that will simply try all possibilities making the search extremely long even for medium-sized problems.

    - *Random sampling* is an alternative to grid search when the number of discrete parameters to optimize, and the time required for each evaluation is high.
      Random search picks the point randomly from the configuration space.

    - *QuasiRandom sampling* ensures a much more uniform exploration of the search space than traditional pseudo random.
      Thus, quasi random sampling is preferable when not all variables are discrete, the number of dimensions is high, and the time required to evaluate a solution is high.

    - *Bayes search* models the search space using gaussian process regression, which allows an estimation of the loss function, and the uncertainty on that estimate at every point of the search space.
      Modeling the search space suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which makes this method more suitable when the number of dimensions is low.

    - *CMAES search* (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) is one of the most powerful black-box optimization algorithm.
      However, it requires a significant number of model evaluation (in the order of 10 to 50 times the number of dimensions) to converge to an optimal solution.
      This search method is more suitable when the time required for a model evaluation is relatively low.

    - *MOCMAES search* (Multi-Objective Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) is a multi-objective algorithm optimizing multiple tradeoffs simultaneously.
      To do that, MOCMAES employs a number of CMAES algorithms.

Here is a table that resumes when to use each algorithm.
|===

== Model as a Service for Machine Learning (MaaS_ML)

Once a predictive model is built, tested and validated, you can easily use it in real world production pipelines by deploying it as a REST Web Service via the MaaS_ML service.
MaaS_ML is dedicated to make deployments of lightweight machine learning (ML) models simple, portable, and scalable, and to easily manage their lifetimes. This will be particularly useful for engineering or business teams that want to take advantage of this model.

The life cycle of any MaaS_ML instance (i.e., from starting the generic service instance, deploying an AI specific model to pausing or deleting the instance) can be managed in three different ways in PML :

- Using the *Studio Portal* and more specifically the bucket *model-as-a-service* where specific generic tasks are provided to process all the possible actions (i.e., MaaS_ML_Service_Start, MaaS_ML_Deploy_Model, MaaS_ML_Call_Prediction, MaaS_ML_Actions[Finish/Pause/Resume]).
These tasks can be easily integrated to your AI pipelines/workflows as you can see in this <<Deployment Pipeline Example>>.
- Using the *Service Automation Portal* by executing the different actions associated to MaaS_ML (i.e. Deploy_ML_Model, Pause_MaaS_ML, Update_MaaS_ML, Finish_MaaS_ML.)
- Using the *Swagger UI* which is accessible once the MaaS_ML instance is up and running.

Once a MaaS_ML instance is up and running, it could be used for:

- *AI Model Deployment or Update*: the user has to provide a valid specific AI Model identifier in order to deploy the model of his/her choice.

- *Call of Predictions*: when a specific AI model is running, the user can request predictions for a specific payload. This latter has to be converted into json data in order to get prediction values.

- *Deploy a New Specific AI Model*: the running generic AI model can be used to deploy a new specific AI model.

Using MaaS_ML, you can easily deploy and use any machine learning model as a REST Web Service on a physical or a virtual compute host on which there is an available Proactive Node. Going through the Proactive Scheduler,
you can also trigger the deployment of a specific VM using the Resource Manager elastic policies, and eventually, deploy a Model-Service on that specific node.

In the following subsections, we will illustrate the life cycle of a MaaS_ML instance, from starting the generic service instance,
deploying a specific model, pausing it, to deleting the instance. We will also talk about how the life cycle of a MaaS_ML instance
can be managed via three different ways in PML:

. <<Via Studio Portal>>
. <<Via Service Automation Portal>>
. <<Via Swagger UI>>

In the description below, multiple tables represent the main variables that characterize the MaaS_ML workflows.
In addition to the variables mentioned below, there is a set of generic variables that are common between all workflows
which can be found in the subsection <<AI Workflows Common Variables>>.
The management of the life cycle of MaaS_ML will be detailed in the next sub-sections.

There are also two other actions that can be executed from the Service Automation Portal which are:

- *Deploy_ML_Model*: This action will put the service instance into deployment.

- *Update_MaaS_ML*: This action will update the deployed instance according to the updated variables.

- *Pause_MaaS_ML*: This action will pause the service instance.


When running the Model Service with Singularity as an Engine, the *Pause_MaaS_ML* action can not be executed.

==== Audit and Traceability
To access the Audit and Traceability page, click on the endpoint under the Endpoint list.

In this page, you are able to check the different values of the model variables.
You can also track the traceability information of the token during several date/time(s) as shown in the below image.

image::traceability1.png[align=center]

It is possible to visualize the model predictions by clicking on the first link in the top of the page.
This link will take you to a *Predictions Preview* page that lists the set of predictions corresponding to the input dataset.


=== Via Swagger UI

To access the Swagger UI, click on the second link in the top of the Traceability & Audit page.

Through this Swagger UI, you are now able to:

** Ask for an api_token
** Deploy a model
** List the deployed models
** Make predictions
** Return stored predictions
** Redeploy a previous deployed model
** Return the stored traceability information
** Remove deployed model
** Update the service parameter

==== Deploy/Undeploy/Redeploy a Specific ML Model

You can also deploy a specific ML model using the Swagger UI:

Open the Swagger UI.

Open the `get_token` operation and get an api_token by entering your username (default value is `user`).

Open the `deploy` operation and set the provided token and upload the model that need to be deployed.

image::NEW_MAS_Deploy_Swagger.png[align=center]

Open `list_models` to return the list of all already deployed models.

Open `redeploy` to redeploy a previously deployed model using its token.

Open `undeploy` to remove a deployed model using its token.

==== Call the Service for Predictions

Open the `predict` operation and set the provided token, and the data that you need to score.

image::MAS_Predict_Swagger.png[align=center]



=== Deployment Pipeline Example

You can connect the different tasks in a single workflow to get the full pipeline from the model training step to the model deployment and consumption steps. Each task will propagate the acquired variables to its children tasks.
The following workflow example is available on the `model_as_a_service` bucket under the name of `IRIS_Deploy_Flower_Classifier_Model`.
This example trains an Iris Flower Classifier, starts a service instance where the trained model is deployed, and the input data is scored by consuming the endpoints exposed by the MaaS_ML service.

image::NEW_MAAS_ML_IRIS_Workflow_Example.PNG[align=center]

=== Customize the Service

It is possible to customize the model as a service defined by default and adapt it to your specific needs. Indeed, you can customize the following elements according to your needs:

* The file specified in the PYTHON_ENTRYPOINT variable
* The file specified in the YAML_FILE variable
* The docker image specified in the DOCKER_IMAGE variable

In the following, we describe in depth the content of each element:

*PYTHON_ENTRYPOINT file*:  The following python script refers to the ml_service.py file stored in the catalog under the `model_as_a_service_resources` bucket.
This script defines the different functions needed to deploy the model, score data and generate tokens.
It is possible to edit this script to make it more customized to your model. The entry script must take into consideration the:

* List of users that are allowed to consume the service endpoints
* Format of the model expected by the deployment, and the prediction functions (e.g., pickle, joblib, etc.)
* Format of the incoming data (e.g., JSON, Array, Matrix, etc.)
* Data format expected by the model (e.g., JSON, Array, Matrix, etc.)

[NOTE]
====
The `model_as_a_service_resources` bucket can be found under the *Catalog* section in the *Automation Dashboard* portal.
====

*YAML_FILE file*:  The following YAML script refers to the ml_service-api.yml file stored in the catalog under the `model_as_a_service_resources` bucket.
This script defines the OpenAPI specification describing the entire API built once a model_service is started.
You can adapt and edit this script in order to customize your service.

*DOCKER_IMAGE name*: Choose your own image containing the different dependencies required to run your ENTRYPOINT_SCRIPT.
Activeeon provides a pre-built image https://github.com/ow2-proactive/docker/blob/master/dlm3/Dockerfile[activeeon/model_as_a_service] Ã¬ncluding different machine learning and deep learning libraries.
If you need to use your own docker image to start the service, you need to install the following libraries in your image:

[source,bash]
----
# install java
apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk
apt-get install ca-certificates-java && update-ca-certificates -f
JAVA_HOME /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/
export JAVA_HOME
apt-get clean

# install python libraries
pip install connexion[swagger-ui]# <1>
pip install py4j# <2>

# install your dependent libraries
...
----
<1> _Connexion_ allows you to write an OpenAPI specification, then maps the endpoints to your Python functions.
<2> _py4j_ enables Python programs running in a Python interpreter to dynamically access Java objects in a Java Virtual Machine.

=== Data Drift Detection (DDD)
The data evolves over time and can therefore cause degradations affecting the
intrinsic characteristics and behavior of the learning model.
Data drift is one of the main reasons why the accuracy of the model degrades over time.
Therefore, it is important that the model is able to adapt to these changes.
Monitoring data drifts allows detecting the model performance drops (as in the figure below) to take
actions accordingly. To deal with this problem, we have integrated a data drift
detection mechanism in the Machine Learning as a Service module of ProActive.

image::drift.png[align=center]

This mechanism enables the discovery of data drifts at a fine level of granularity.
We have developed a DDD mechanism that not only allows us to discover that a drift
has occurred, but also to indicate the exact location of the drift in the input dataset.
It can specify on which attributes or characteristics and more precisely on which lines
the drift occurred.


This allows the user to better manage the drift and to act accordingly.
In fact, the input data set is monitored using different methods of data drift
detection in which the user is free to choose the one that best suits his needs.
Currently, we use three well-known methods for this purpose: HDDM, Page Hinkley and ADWIN.
This list is likely to be expanded in the future to include other drift detection methods.
To detect drift in a new dataset, it is necessary to compare it to the old training
dataset on which the model was trained. Thus, any detected drift indicates that the
model is not the best predictor and that new training on the new dataset should take place.

As the DDD function is part of the MaaS_ML module,
it can also be launched from different Proactive portals.

==== Via Studio Portal
The data drift detection mechanism is added to the tasks and workflows of the bucket
*model_as_a_service*. This mechanism is directly linked to the deployment of the model
in MaaS_ML (where the user deploys the model, and a part of the
old training dataset to be used for drift detection in the new input data set),
and to the call of the prediction service in MaaS_ML (where the drift detector is chosen,
and the detection process is started using the chosen detector).

The workflow *IRIS_Deploy_Predict_Flower_Classifier_Model*, found in the
*model_as_a_service* bucket in the Proactive Studio Portal, shows an example of pipeline using the generic tasks
*MaaS_ML_Deploy_Model* and *MaaS_ML_Call_Prediction* including the DDD mechanism.

In particular, in the *MaaS_ML_Deploy_Model* task, the user is asked to enter
*DRIFT_DETECTION_WINDOW_SIZE* which is a task variable specifying the size of the data
to be extracted from the old training dataset (the dataset on which the model was initially
trained). For example, if the user chooses a value = 50 for this variable, the algorithm will
randomly choose 50 lines from the old training dataset. This subset of data (we call it *baseline data*) 
will be saved in the service in order to be used afterward for the data drift detection process 
which will be enacted in the *MaaS_ML_Call_Prediction*.

In the *Call_Prediction_Service*, the user is asked to choose the data drift
detector to be used in the drift detection process. This can be chosen by using the task
variable *DATA_DRIFT_DETECTOR* in which the user can choose one of HDDM, Page Hinkley
or ADWIN as a drift detector. The algorithm here concatenates the deployed baseline_data
to the new input (to be predicted) dataset. The chosen drift detector then will
use the concatenated data to extract the rows and columns where the drift took place in the new data.
These drift detection algorithms are enhanced in Proactive to be able to detect the attributes
where the drift occurred (the columns).

The obtained predictions and drifts can be viewed in the resulting output of the
Proactive Scheduler Portal.

==== Via Service Automation Portal and Swagger UI


As we have mentioned earlier in this documentation, a model can be deployed using the *MaaS_ML* in the
*Service_Automation* of the Automation Dashboard Portal. To enable the data drift detection process, the *DRIFT_ENABLED* variable
should be set to True. Once the service is launched, the model can be deployed by
choosing *Deploy_MaaS_ML* action. In the *Deploy_MaaS_ML* variables, the user can specify the url of the
baseline_data using the *BASELINE_DATA_URL* variable that appears in the popup window of
*Deploy_Model_Service* action. In case you need to change the baseline data, it can be updated using the *BASELINE_DATA_URL*
variable of the *Update_MaaS_ML* action of MaaS_ML.

Once the model is deployed via the Service Automation portal,
the Swagger user interface can be opened via the MaaS_ML instance api, offering different endpoints
to help the user manage the drift detection mechanism. This
mechanism has been particularly integrated into the following three endpoints:

- In the */deploy()* endpoint, a user can choose the model (using *model_file* variable) and its associated baseline data (using *baseline_data* variable)
to be deployed.

- In the */predict()* endpoint, the user specifies the drift detection method, and the input data to be predicted. Using the baseline data and the
specified drift detector method, our algorithm can detect in which attributes and particularly
which rows the drift took place in the input data. The results are shown in *Response Body*
of the */predict()* endpoint and in the *Traceability and Audit* page.

- In the */update* endpoint, the user is able to update the baseline data deployed with the model using the *baseline_data*
variable.

In case a data drift has occurred, a user will receive a notification using the Proactive
*Notification* service in the Automation Dashboard.

== Model as a Service for Deep Learning (MaaS_DL)
MaaS_DL is a model deployment service for putting AI models to production. MaaS_DL comes with new capabilities, compared to MaaS_ML, enabling users to deploy deep learning models, to update the deployed models with an updated version and to easily rollback to any previous version(s).
It provides out-of-the-box integration with TensorFlow Serving TFX taking advantage of its flexibility and high-performance serving system.

The life cycle of any MaaS_DL instance (i.e., from starting the generic service instance, deploying an AI specific model to pausing or deleting the instance) can be managed in three different ways in PML :

- Using the *Studio Portal* and more specifically the bucket *model-as-a-service* where specific generic tasks are provided to process all the possible actions (i.e., MaaS_DL_Service_Start, MaaS_DL_Deploy_Model, MaaS_DL_Actions[Finish/Pause/Resume], MaaS_DL_Undeploy_Model).
These tasks can be easily integrated to your AI pipelines/workflows as you can see in this <<Deployment Pipeline Example>>.
- Using the *Service Automation Portal* by executing the different actions associated to MaaS_DL (i.e. Deploy_DL_Model, Redeploy_DL_Model, Undeploy_DL_Model)
- Using the *Swagger UI* which is accessible once the MaaS_DL instance is up and running.

Using MaaS_DL, you can easily deploy and use any machine or deep learning model as a REST Web Service on a physical or a virtual compute host on which there is an available Proactive Node. Going through the Proactive Scheduler,
you can also trigger the deployment of a specific VM using the Resource Manager elastic policies, and eventually, deploy a Model-Service on that specific node.

In the following subsections, we will illustrate the life cycle of a MaaS_DL instance, from starting the generic service instance,
deploying a specific model, undeploying it, to deleting the instance. We will also talk about how the life cycle of a MaaS_DL instance
can be managed via three different ways in PML:

. <<Via Studio Portal>>
. <<Via Service Automation Portal>>
. <<Via Swagger UI>>

In the description below, multiple tables represent the main variables that characterize the MaaS_DL workflows.
In addition to the variables mentioned below, there is a set of generic variables that are common between all workflows
which can be found in the subsection <<AI Workflows Common Variables>>.
The management of the life cycle of MaaS_DL will be detailed in the next sub-sections.

== Proactive Analytics

The *ProActive Analytics* is a dashboard that provides an overview of executed workflows
along with their input variables and results.

It offers several functionalities, including:

- Advanced search by name, user, date, state, etc.
- Execution metrics summary about durations, encountered issues, etc.
- Charts to track variables and results evolution and correlation.
- Data exportation in multiple formats for further use in analytics tools.

Proactive Analytics is very useful to compare metrics and charts of workflows that have common variables and results. For example, a ML algorithm might take different variables values and produce multiple results. It would be interesting to analyze the correlation and evolution of the algorithm results regarding the input variation (See also a similar example of link:../PML/PMLUserGuide.html#_AutoML[AutoML]).
The following sections will show you some key features of the dashboard and how to use them for a better understanding of your job executions.

[[_job_search]]
=== Job Analytics

Job Analytics Page includes a search window that allows users to search for jobs based on specific criteria (see screenshot below).
The job search panel allows selecting multi-value filters for the following job parameters:

- _Workflow Name(s)_: Jobs can be filtered by workflow name. Selecting/Typing one or more workflow names is provided by a built-in `auto-complete` feature that helps you search for workflows or buckets from the link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_catalog_portal[ProActive Catalog.]
- _Project Name(s)_: You can also filter by one or more project names. You just have to specify the project names for the jobs you would like to analyze.
- _Job Status_: You can specify the state of jobs you are looking for. The possible job status are: `Pending`, `Running`, `Stalled`, `Paused`, `In_Error`, `Finished`, `Canceled`, `Failed`, and `Killed`. For more information about job status, check the documentation link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_status[here.] Multiple values are accepted as well.
- _User(s)_: This filter allows to either select only the jobs of the connected/current user or to specify a list of users that have executed the jobs. By default, the toggle filter is activated to select only the user jobs.
- _Submission Time_: From the dropdown list, users can select a submission time frame (e.g., yesterday, last week, this month, etc.), or choose custom dates.
- _Variables and results_: It is possible to choose whether to display or not the workflow's variables and results. When deactivated, the charts related to variables and results evolution/correlation will not be displayed in the dashboard.

More advanced search options (_highlighted in advanced search hints_) could be used to provide filter values such as _wildcards_. For example, names that start with a specific string value are selected using `value*`. Other supported expressions are: `_\*value_` for _Ends with_, `*value*` for _Contains_, `!value` for _Not equals_, and `!\*value*` for _Not contains_.

Now you can hit the search button to request jobs from the scheduler database according to the provided filter values. The search bar at the top shows a summary of the active search filters.

[[_JA-search-png]]
image::JA-search.png[align=center]

==== Execution Metrics

As shown in the screenshot below, Job Analytics Portal provides a summary of the most important job execution metrics. For instance, the dashboard shows:

- A first panel that displays the number of total jobs that correspond to the search query. It also shows the ratio of successful jobs over the total number, and the number of jobs that are in progress and not yet finished. Please note that the number of in-progress jobs corresponds to the moment when the search query is executed and it is not automatically refreshed.
- A second summary panel that displays the number of jobs with issues. We distinguish two types of issues: jobs that are finished but have encountered issues during their execution and interrupted jobs that did not finish their execution and were stopped due to diverse causes, such as insufficient resources, manual interruption, etc. Interrupted jobs include four status: `In-Error`, `Failed`, `Canceled`, and `Killed`.
- The last metric gives an overview of the average duration of the selected jobs.

image::JA-metrics.png[align=center]

==== Job Charts

Job Analytics includes three types of charts:

- *Job duration chart:* This chart shows durations per job. The x-axis shows the job ID and the y-axis shows the job duration. Hovering over the lines will also display the same information as a tooltip (see screenshot below). Using the duration chart will eventually help the users to identify any abnormal performance behaviour among several workflow executions.
[[_JA-duration]]

image::JA-duration.png[align=center]
- *Job variables chart:* This chart is intended to show all variable values of selected jobs. It represents the evolution chart for all numeric-only variables of the selected jobs. The chart provides the ability to hide or show specific input variables by clicking on the variable name in the legend, as shown in the figure below.

- *Job results chart:* This chart is intended to show all result values of selected jobs. It represents the evolution chart for all numeric-only results of the selected jobs. The chart provides also the ability to hide or show specific results by clicking on the variable name in the legend, as shown in the figure below.

image::JA-chart.png[align=center]

All charts provide some advanced features such as "maximize" and "enlarge" to better visualize the results, and "move" to customize the dashboard layout (see top left side of charts). All of them provide the hovering feature as previously described and two types of charts to display: line and bar charts. Switching from one to the other can be activated through a toggle button located at the top right of the chart. Same for show/hide variables and results.

==== Job Execution Table

The last element of the Job Analytics dashboard shows a summary table that contains all job executions returned by the search query. It includes the job ID, status, duration, submission time, variables, results, etc.
The jobs table provides many features:

- _Filtering_: users can specify filter values for every column. For instance, the picture below applies a filter on the duration where we filter only jobs that last more than 30s. For string values, we can apply string-related filters such as _Contains_. For dates, a calendar is displayed to help users select the right date. Please note that variables and results types are not automatically detected. Therefore, users can choose either the _Contains_ filter or the _Greater than_ and _Less than_ filters.
- _Sort, hide, pin left and right columns_: allows users to easily handle and display data with respect to their needs.
- _Export the job data to CSV format_: enables users to exploit and process job data using other analytics tools such as R, Matlab, BI tools, ML APIs, etc.
- _Clear and apply filters_: When filters are applied, the displayed data is updated. Therefore, we provide a button (see _apply filters to charts_ on the top left of the of the table screenshot) that allows synchronizing the charts with the filtered data in the table. Finally, it is possible to clear all filters. This will automatically deactivate the synchronization.
- _Link to scheduler jobs_: data in the job ID column is linked to the job executions in the scheduler. For example, if users want to access to the logs of a failing job, they can click on the corresponding job ID to be redirected to the job location in the Scheduling Portal.

We note also that clicking on the issue types and charts described in the previous sections filters the table to show the corresponding jobs.

NOTE: It is important to notice that the dashboard layout and search preferences are saved in the browser cache so that users can have access to their last dashboard and search settings.

== ProActive Jupyter Kernel

The ActiveEon Jupyter Kernel adds a kernel backend to Jupyter. This kernel interfaces directly with the ProActive
scheduler and constructs tasks and workflows to execute them on the fly.

With this interface, users can run their code locally and test it using a native python kernel, and by a simple switch to
ProActive kernel, run it on remote public or private infrastructures without having to modify the code. See the example below:

image::direct_execution_from_jupyter.png[Direct execution from Jupyter with ActiveEon Kernel]

=== Installation

==== Requirements

Python 2 or 3

==== Using PyPi

* open a terminal

* install the ProActive jupyter kernel with the following commands:

```bash
$ pip install proactive proactive-jupyter-kernel --upgrade
$ python -m proactive-jupyter-kernel.install
```

==== Using source code

* open a terminal

* clone the repository on your local machine:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ow2-proactive/proactive-jupyter-kernel.git
```

* install the ProActive jupyter kernel with the following commands:

```bash
$ pip install proactive-jupyter-kernel/
$ python -m proactive-jupyter-kernel.install
```

=== Platform

You can use any jupyter platform.
We recommend to use https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[jupyter lab]. To launch it from your terminal after
having installed it:

```bash
$ jupyter lab
```
or in daemon mode:
```bash
$ nohup jupyter lab &>/dev/null &
```

When opened, click on the ProActive icon to open a notebook based on the ProActive kernel.

=== Help

As a quick start, we recommend the user to run the `#%help()` pragma using the following script:

```python
#%help()
```

This script gives a brief description of all the different pragmas that the ProActive Kernel provides.

To get a more detailed description of a needed pragma, the user can run the following script:

```python
#%help(pragma=PRAGMA_NAME)
```

=== Connection

==== Using connect()

If you are trying ProActive for the first time, sign up on the https://try.activeeon.com/signup.html[try platform].
Once you receive your login and password, connect to the trial platform using the `#%connect()` pragma:

```python
#%connect(login=YOUR_LOGIN, password=YOUR_PASSWORD)
```

To connect to another ProActive server host, use the later pragma this way:

```python
#%connect(host=YOUR_HOST, [port=YOUR_PORT], login=YOUR_LOGIN, password=YOUR_PASSWORD)
```

NOTE: Notice that the `port` parameter is optional. The default connexion port is `8080`.

You can also connect to a distant server by providing its `url` in the following way:

```python
#%connect(url=YOUR_SERVER_URL, login=YOUR_LOGIN, password=YOUR_PASSWORD)
```

By providing the complete `url` of the server, users can eventually connect through the secure HTTPS protocol.

==== Using a configuration file

For automatic sign in, create a file named *proactive_config.ini* in your notebook working directory.

Fill your configuration file according to one of the following two formats:

- By providing the server `host` and `port`:

```ini
[proactive_server]
host=YOUR_HOST
port=YOUR_PORT
[user]
login=YOUR_LOGIN
password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

- By providing the server `url`:

```ini
[proactive_server]
url=YOUR_SERVER_URL
[user]
login=YOUR_LOGIN
password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

Save your changes and restart the ProActive kernel.

You can also force the current kernel to connect using any _.ini_ config file through the `#%connect()` pragma:

```python
#%connect(path=PATH_TO/YOUR_CONFIG_FILE.ini)
```

(For more information about this format please check
https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html[configParser])

=== Usage

==== Creating a Python task

To create a new task, use the pragma `#%task()` followed by the task implementation script written into a notebook
block code.
To use this pragma, a task name has to be provided at least. Example:

```python
#%task(name=myTask)
print('Hello world')
```

General usage:

```python
#%task(name=TASK_NAME, [language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE], [dep=[TASK_NAME1,TASK_NAME2,...]], [generic_info=[(KEY1,VAL1), (KEY2,VALUE2),...]], [variables=[(VAR1,VAL1), (VAR2,VALUE2),...]], [export=[VAR_NAME1,VAR_NAME2,...]], [import=[VAR_NAME1,VAR_NAME2,...]], [path=IMPLEMENTATION_FILE_PATH])\n'
```

Users can also provide more information about the task using the pragma's options. In the following, we give more
details about the possible options:

===== Language

The `language` parameter is needed when the task script is not written in native Python. If not provided, Python will be
 selected as the default language.
The supported programming languages are:

* Linux_Bash
* Windows_Cmd
* DockerCompose
* Scalaw
* Groovy
* Javascript
* Jython
* Python
* Ruby
* Perl
* PowerShell
* R

Here is an example that shows a task implementation written in `Linux_Bash`:

```bash
#%task(name=myTask, language=Linux_Bash)
echo 'Hello, World!'
```

===== Dependencies

One of the most important notions in workflows is the dependencies between tasks. To specify this information, use the
`dep` parameter. Its value should be a list of all tasks on which the new task depends. Example:

```python
#%task(name=myTask,dep=[parentTask1,parentTask2])
print('Hello world')
```

===== Variables

To specify https://doc.activeeon.com/latest/user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_task_variables[task variables],
you should provide the `variables` parameter. Its value should be a list of tuples `(key,value)` that corresponds to
the names and adequate values of the corresponding task variables. Example:

```python
#%task(name=myTask, variables=[(var1,value1),(var2,value2)])
print('Hello world')
```

===== Generic information

To specify the values of some advanced ProActive variables called
https://doc.activeeon.com/latest/user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_generic_information[Generic Information], you should
provide the `generic_info` parameter. Its value should be a list of tuples `(key,value)` that corresponds to the names
and adequate values of the Generic Information. Example:

```python
#%task(name=myTask, generic_info=[(var1,value1),(var2,value2)])
print('Hello world')
```

===== Export/import variables

The `export` and `import` parameters ensure variables propagation between the different tasks of a workflow.
If `myTask1` variables `var1` and `var2` are needed in `myTask2`, both pragmas have to specify this information as
follows:

* `myTask1` should include an `export` parameter with a list of these variable names,
* `myTask2` should include an `import` parameter with a list including the same names.

Example:

`myTask1` implementation block would be:
```python
#%task(name=myTask1, export=[var1,var2])
var1 = "Hello"
var2 = "ActiveEon!"
```

and `myTask2` implementation block would be:
```python
#%task(name=myTask2, dep=[myTask1], import[var1,var2])
print(var1 + " from " + var2)
```

===== Implementation file

It is also possible to use an external implementation file to define the task implementation. To do so, the option `path`
 should be used.

Example:

```python
#%task(name=myTask,path=PATH_TO/IMPLEMENTATION_FILE.py)
```

==== Importing libraries

The main difference between the ProActive and 'native language' kernels resides in the way the memory is accessed
during blocks execution. In a common native language kernel, the whole script code (all the notebook blocks) is
locally executed in the same shared memory space; whereas the ProActive kernel will execute each created task in an
independent process. In order to facilitate the transition from native language to ProActive kernels, we included the
pragma `#%import()`. This pragma gives the user the ability to add libraries that are common to all created tasks, and
thus relative distributed processes, that are implemented in the same native script language.

The import pragma is used as follows:

`#%import([language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE])`.

Example:

```python
#%import(language=Python)
import os
import pandas
```

NOTE: If the language is not specified, Python is considered as default language.

==== Adding a fork environment

To configure a fork environment for a task, use the `#%fork_env()` pragma. To do so, you have to provide the name of the
corresponding task and the fork environment implementation.

Example:

```python
#%fork_env(name=TASK_NAME)
dockerImageName = 'activeeon/dlm3'
dockerRunCommand =  'docker run '
dockerParameters = '--rm '
paHomeHost = variables.get("PA_SCHEDULER_HOME")
paHomeContainer = variables.get("PA_SCHEDULER_HOME")
proActiveHomeVolume = '-v '+paHomeHost +':'+paHomeContainer+' '
workspaceHost = localspace
workspaceContainer = localspace
workspaceVolume = '-v '+localspace +':'+localspace+' '
containerWorkingDirectory = '-w '+workspaceContainer+' '
preJavaHomeCmd = dockerRunCommand + dockerParameters + proActiveHomeVolume + workspaceVolume + containerWorkingDirectory + dockerImageName
```

Or, you can provide the task name and the path of a _.py_ file containing the fork environment code:

```python
#%fork_env(name=TASK_NAME, path=PATH_TO/FORK_ENV_FILE.py)
```

==== Adding a selection script

To add a selection script to a task, use the `#%selection_script()` pragma. To do so, you have to provide the name of
the corresponding task and the selection code implementation.

Example:

```python
#%selection_script(name=TASK_NAME)
selected = True
```

Or, you can provide the task name and the path of a _.py_ file containing the selection code:

```python
#%selection_script(name=TASK_NAME, path=PATH_TO/SELECTION_CODE_FILE.py)
```

==== Adding job fork environment and/or selection script

If the selection scripts and/or the fork environments are the same for all job tasks, we can add them just once using
the `job_selection_script` and/or the `job_fork_env` pragmas.

Usage:

For a job selection script, please use:

```python
#%job_selection_script([language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE], [path=./SELECTION_CODE_FILE.py], [force=on/off])
```

For a job fork environment, use:

```python
#%job_fork_env([language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE], [path=./FORK_ENV_FILE.py], [force=on/off])
```

The `force` parameter defines whether the pragma has to overwrite the task selection scripts or the fork environment
already set.

==== Adding pre and/or post scripts

Sometimes, specific scripts has to be executed before and/or after a particular task. To do that, the solution provides
 `pre_script` and `post_script` pragmas.

To add a pre-script to a task, please use:

```python
#%pre_script(name=TASK_NAME, language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE, [path=./PRE_SCRIPT_FILE.py])
```

To add a post-script to a task, use:

```python
#%post_script(name=TASK_NAME, language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE, [path=./POST_SCRIPT_FILE.py])
```

==== Branch control

The https://doc.activeeon.com/latest/user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_branch[branch] control provides the ability to
choose between two alternative task flows, with the possibility to merge back to a common one.

To add a branch control to the current workflow, four specific tasks and one control condition should be added in
accordance with the following order:

1. a `branch` task,
2. the related branching `condition` script,
3. an `if` task that should be executed if the result of the `condition` task if `true`,
4. an `else` task that should be executed if the result of the `condition` task if `false`,
5. a `continuation` task that should be executed after the `if` or the `else` tasks.

To add a `branch` task, you can rely on the following macro:

```python
#%branch([name=TASK_NAME], [dep=[TASK_NAME1,TASK_NAME2,...]], [generic_info=[(KEY1,VAL1), (KEY2,VALUE2),...]], [language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE], [path=./FORK_ENV_FILE.py])
```

For the branching `condition` script, use:

```python
#%condition()
```

For an `if` task, please use:

```python
#%if([name=TASK_NAME], [generic_info=[(KEY1,VAL1),(KEY2,VALUE2),...]], [language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE], [path=./FORK_ENV_FILE.py])
```

For an `else` task, use:

```python
#%else([name=TASK_NAME], [generic_info=[(KEY1,VAL1),(KEY2,VALUE2),...]], [language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE], [path=./FORK_ENV_FILE.py])
```

And finally, for the `continuation` task:

```python
#%continuation([name=TASK_NAME], [generic_info=[(KEY1,VAL1),(KEY2,VALUE2),...]], [language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE], [path=./FORK_ENV_FILE.py])
```


==== Loop control

The https://doc.activeeon.com/latest/user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_loop[loop] control provides the ability to repeat
a set of tasks.

To add a loop control to the current workflow, two specific tasks and one control condition should be added
in the following order:

1. a `start` task,
2. the related looping `condition` script,
3. a `loop` task.

For a `start` task, use:

```python
#%start([name=TASK_NAME], [dep=[TASK_NAME1,TASK_NAME2,...]], [generic_info=[(KEY1,VAL1), (KEY2,VALUE2),...]], [language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE], [path=./FORK_ENV_FILE.py])
```

For the looping `condition` script, use:

```python
#%condition()
```

For a `loop` task, please use:

```python
#%loop([name=TASK_NAME], [generic_info=[(KEY1,VAL1),(KEY2,VALUE2),...]], [language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE], [path=./FORK_ENV_FILE.py])
```

==== Replicate control

The https://doc.activeeon.com/latest/user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_replicate[replication] allows executing multiple
tasks in parallel when only one task is defined, and the number of tasks to run could change.

Through the ProActive Jupyter Kernel, users can add replicate controls in two main ways, a generic and a straight
forward way.

===== Generic usage

To add a replicate control to the current workflow in the generic method, three specific tasks and one control runs
script should be added according to the following order:

1. a `split` task,
2. the related replication `runs` script,
3. a `process` task,
4. a `merge` task.

For a `split` task, use:

```python
#%split([name=TASK_NAME], [dep=[TASK_NAME1,TASK_NAME2,...]], [generic_info=[(KEY1,VAL1), (KEY2,VALUE2),...]], [language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE], [path=./FORK_ENV_FILE.py])
```

For the replication `runs` script, use:

```python
#%runs()
```

For a `process` task, please use:

```python
#%process([name=TASK_NAME], [generic_info=[(KEY1,VAL1),(KEY2,VALUE2),...]], [language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE], [path=./FORK_ENV_FILE.py])
```

And finally, for a `merge` task, use:

```python
#%merge([name=TASK_NAME], [generic_info=[(KEY1,VAL1),(KEY2,VALUE2),...]], [language=SCRIPT_LANGUAGE], [path=./FORK_ENV_FILE.py])
```

===== Straight forward usage

The straight forward method to add a replication is most of all useful when the parallelism that should be
implemented is a task parallelism (the generic usage is more adapted to data parallelism).

To add a replication to a task, just add the runs control script by providing the `runs` option of the `task` pragma.
Example:

```python
#%task(name=T2,dep=[T1],runs=3)
print("This output should be displayed 3 times ...")
```

NOTE: To construct a valid workflow, straight forward replicated tasks must have one and only one parent task and one
child task at most. (More information about replicate validation criteria are available
https://doc.activeeon.com/latest/user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_replicate[here]).

==== Delete a task

To delete a task from the workflow, the user should run the pragma `#%delete_task()` in the following way:

```python
#%delete_task(name=TASK_NAME)
```

==== Create a job

To create a job, specify job variables and/or job generic information, use the `#%job()` pragma:

```python
#%job(name=JOB_NAME, [generic_info=[(KEY1,VAL1), (KEY2,VALUE2),...]], [variables=[(VAR1,VAL1), (VAR2,VALUE2),...]])
```

NOTE: It is not necessary to create and assign a name explicitly to the job. If not done by the user, this step is
implicitly performed when the job is submitted (check section <<Submit your job to the scheduler>> for more
information).

==== Visualize job

To visualize the created workflow, use the `#%draw_job()` pragma to plot the workflow graph that represents the job
into a separate window:

```python
#%draw_job()
```

Two optional parameters can be used to configure the way the kernel plots the workflow graph.

**inline plotting:**

If this parameter is set to `off`, plotting the workflow graph is done through a
https://matplotlib.org/[Matplotlib] external window. The default value is `on`.

```python
#%draw_job(inline=off)
```

**save the workflow graph locally:**

To be sure that the workflow is saved into a _.png_ file, this option needs to be set to `on`. The default value is
`off`.

```python
#%draw_job(save=on)
```

Note that the job's name can take one of the following possible values:

1. The parameter `name` 's value, if provided
2. The job's name, if created
3. The notebook's name, if the kernel can retrieve it
4. `Unnamed_job`, otherwise

General usage:

```python
#%draw_job([name=JOB_NAME], [inline=off], [save=on])
```

==== Export the workflow graph in dot format

To export the created workflow into a https://www.graphviz.org/[GraphViz] _.dot_ format, use the `#%write_dot()` pragma:

```python
#%write_dot(name=FILE_NAME)
```

==== Import a workflow from a dot file

To create a workflow according to a https://www.graphviz.org/[GraphViz] _.dot_ file, use the pragma `#%import_dot()`:

```python
#%import_dot(path=PATH_TO/FILE_NAME.dot)
```

By default, the workflow will contain _Python_ tasks with empty implementation scripts. If you want to modify or add
any information to a specific task, please use, as explained in <<Creating a Python task>>, the `#%task()` pragma.

==== Submit your job to the scheduler

To submit the job to the ProActive Scheduler, the user has to use the `#%submit_job()` pragma:

```python
#%submit_job()
```

If the job is not created, or is not up-to-date, the `#%submit_job()` creates a new job named as the old one.
To provide a new name, use the same pragma and provide a name as parameter:

```python
#%submit_job([name=JOB_NAME])
```

If the job's name is not set, the ProActive kernel uses the current notebook name, if possible, or gives a random one.

==== List all submitted jobs

To get all submitted job IDs and names, use `list_submitted_jobs` pragma this way:

```python
#%list_submitted_jobs()
```

==== Export the workflow in XML format

To export the created workflow in _.xml_ format, use the `#%export_xml()` pragma:

```python
#%export_xml([name=FILENAME])
```

Notice that the _.xml_ file will be saved under one of the following names:

1. The parameter `name` 's value, if provided
2. The job's name, if created
3. The notebook's name, if the kernel can retrieve it
4. `Unnamed_job`, otherwise

==== Get results

After the execution of a ProActive workflow, two outputs can be obtained:

* results: values that have been saved in the
https://doc.activeeon.com/latest/user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_task_result[task result variable],

* console outputs: classic outputs that have been displayed/printed.

To get task results, please use the `#%get_task_result()` pragma by providing the task name, and either the job ID or
the job name:

```python
#%get_task_result([job_id=JOB_ID], [job_name=JOB_NAME], task_name=TASK_NAME)
```

The result(s) of all the tasks of a job can be obtained with the `#%get_job_result()` pragma, by providing the job name
or the job ID:

```python
#%get_job_result([job_id=JOB_ID], [job_name=JOB_NAME])
```

To get and display console outputs of a task, you can use the `#%print_task_output()` pragma in the following
way:

```python
#%print_task_output([job_id=JOB_ID], [job_name=JOB_NAME], task_name=TASK_NAME)
```

Finally, the  `#%print_job_output()` pragma allows printing all job outputs, by providing the job name or the job ID:

```python
#%print_job_output([job_id=JOB_ID], [job_name=JOB_NAME])
```

NOTE: If neither `job_name` nor the `job_id` are provided, the last submitted job is selected by default.

=== Display and use ActiveEon Portals directly in Jupyter

Finally, to have the hand on more parameters and features, the user should use ActiveEon Studio portals.
The main ones are the _Resource Manager_, the _Scheduling Portal_ and the _Workflow Automation_.

The example below shows how the user can directly monitor his submitted job's execution in the scheduling portal:

image::direct_submit_and_see_from_jupyter.png[Directly in Jupyter: Submit, See your Job executing, Get Results]

To show the resource manager portal related to the host you are connected to, just run:

```python
#%show_resource_manager([host=YOUR_HOST], [height=HEIGHT_VALUE], [width=WIDTH_VALUE])
```

For the related scheduling portal:

```python
#%show_scheduling_portal([host=YOUR_HOST], [height=HEIGHT_VALUE], [width=WIDTH_VALUE])
```

And, for the related workflow automation:

```python
#%show_workflow_automation([host=YOUR_HOST], [height=HEIGHT_VALUE], [width=WIDTH_VALUE])
```

NOTE: The parameters `height` and `width` allow the user to adjust the size of the window inside the notebook.

== Customize the ML Bucket

=== Create or Update an ML Task

*Machine Learning Bucket* contains various open source tasks that can be easily used by a simple drag and drop.

It is possible to enrich the ML Bucket by adding your own tasks. (see section 4.3)

It is also possible to customize the code of the generic ML tasks. In this case, you need to drag and drop the targeted task to modify its code in the *Task Implementation* section.

NOTE: It is also possible to add or/and delete variables of each task, set your own fork environments, etc. More details available on link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_studio_tasks[ProActive User Guide^]

=== Set the Fork Environment

A fork execution environment is a new Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which is started exclusively to execute a task. Starting a new JVM means that the task inside it will run in a new environment. This environment can be set up by the creator of the task. A new JVMs is set up with a new classpath, new system properties and more customization.

We used a `Docker fork environment` for all the ML tasks. *activeeon/dlm3* was used as a docker container for all tasks. If your task needs to install new ML libraries which are not available in this container, then, use your own docker container or an appropriate environment with the needed libraries.

NOTE: The use of docker containers is recommended as that way other tasks will not be affected by change. Docker containers provide isolation so that the host machineâs software stays the same. More details available on link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_fork_environment[ProActive User Guide^]

=== Publish a ML Task

The `Catalog` menu provides the possibility for a user to publish newly created or/and update tasks inside *Machine Learning Bucket*, you need just to click on `Catalog` Menu then `Publish current Workflow to the Catalog`.
Choose `machine-leaning` Bucket to store your newly added workflow on it.
If the Task with the same name already exists in the 'machine-leaning' bucket, then, it will be updated.
We recommend submitting Tasks with a commit message for easier differentiation between the different submitted versions.

NOTE: More details available on link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_publish_current_workflow_to_the_catalog[ProActive User Guide^]

=== Create a ML Workflow

The link:https://try.activeeon.com/tutorials/quickstart/quickstart.html[quickstart tutorial, window="_blank"] on link:https://try.activeeon.com[try.activeeon.com, window="_blank"]
shows you how to build a simple workflow using ProActive Studio.

We show below an example of a workflow created with the Studio:

image::ML_Workflow_Example.png[align="center"]

At the left part, are illustrated the **General Parameters** of the workflow with the following information:

- `Name`: the name of the workflow.
- `Project`: the project name to which belongs the workflow.
- `Description`: the textual description of the workflow.
- `Documentation`: if the workflow has a Generic Information named "Documentation", then its URL value is displayed as a link.
- `Job Priority`: the priority assigned to the workflow. It is by default set to `NORMAL`, but can be increased or decreased once the job is submitted.

NOTE: The workflow represented in the above is available on the 'machine-learning-workflows' bucket.
