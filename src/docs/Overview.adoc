*ProActive Scheduler* is a free and open-source *job scheduler*. The user specifies the computation in terms of a series of computation
 steps along with their execution and data dependencies. The Scheduler executes this computation on a cluster
 of computation resources, each step on the best-fit resource and in parallel wherever its possible.

On the top left is the Studio interface that allows you to build Workflows.
It can be interactively configured to address specific domains, for instance Finance, Big Data, IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI). See for instance the Documentation of Machine Learning Open Studio https://www.activeeon.com/public_content/documentation/latest/MLOS/MLOSUserGuide.html[here^], and try it online https://try.activeeon.com/studio/#workflows/templates/machine-learning[here^]. In the middle is the Scheduler that enables an enterprise to orchestrate and automate Multi-users, Multi-application Jobs.
Finally, at the bottom right is the Resource manager interface that manage and automate resource provisioning
on any Public Cloud, on any virtualization software, on any container system, and on any Physical Machine of any OS.
