*ProActive Scheduler* is a free and open-source *job scheduler*. The user specifies the computation in terms of a series of computation
 steps along with their execution and data dependencies. The Scheduler executes this computation on a cluster
 of computation resources, each step on the best-fit resource and in parallel wherever its possible.
