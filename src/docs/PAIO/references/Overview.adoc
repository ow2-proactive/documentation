*ProActive AI Orchestration (PAIO)* is a complete DSML platform (Data Science and Machine Learning) including a ML Studio, AutoML, Data Science Orchestration and MLOps for the deployment,
training, execution and scalability of artificial intelligence and machine learning models on
any type of infrastructure. Created for data scientists and ML engineers, the solution is simple to use and accelerate the development and deployment of machine learning models.

ProActive AI Orchestration platform provides a rich catalog of generic machine learning tasks that can be connected together to build either basic or advanced machine learning workflows for various use cases such as: fraud detection, text analysis, online offer recommendations, prediction of equipment failures, facial expression analysis, etc.
PAIO workflows enable users to manage machine learning pipelines through the different phases of the development lifecycle and allow them to better control tasks parallelization, by running the tasks on resources matching constraints (Multi-CPU, GPU, FPGA, data locality, libraries, etc).

The ProActive AI Orchestration platform is an open source solution, and it can be tested online without installation on our try platforms https://try.activeeon.com/studio/#presets/1[here^].

PAIO also encompasses a range of interfaces that serve as centralized hubs, offering real-time monitoring, collaboration, and decision-making capabilities across various stages of the machine learning operational pipeline. By providing insights into model performance, infrastructure health, and deployment status, these interfaces empower teams to optimize and enhance the reliability of their machine learning systems.

The *MLOps Dashboard* (screenshot above) serves as a centralized hub for data scientists, engineers, and stakeholders involved in deploying and monitoring machine learning models. It provides a comprehensive view of the deployment pipelines, real-time performance metrics, and key indicators. Furthermore, it includes features specifically designed to manage and monitor the underlying model servers.
