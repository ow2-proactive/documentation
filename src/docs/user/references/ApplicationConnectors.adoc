The `application-connectors` bucket contains diverse generic application connectors for the most frequently used cloud data management systems (ERP, ETL, LDAP, Reporting and Monitoring, and ServiceNow).The aim of an application connector is to facilitate and simplify the integration of a cloud application in your workflows.

=== ETL

The ETL connectors allow connecting to data servers and benefit from their features.
The following presents the various ETL connectors that PWS handle.

==== Informatica

The Informatica workflow consists of one task.

*Variables:*

The Informatica workflow consists of a list of variables described in the following table.

=== ServiceNow
*Product Name:* ServiceNow +
*Product Version:* Quebec +
*Compatibility:* Tokyo

The ServiceNow connectors allow ProActive to communicate with ServiceNow instances to perform CRUD operations on their data as well as to send emails.

The installation of the ProActive application in ServiceNow, which enables a ServiceNow instance to communication with a ProActive server, is described
in the link:../../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.adoc#_servicenow_integration[ServiceNow admin documentation].

==== ProActive to ServiceNow

A set of ProActive workflow templates are available in the catalog to communicate with ServiceNow.
They are usually integrated as a task or a subworkflow in an end-to-end workflow and perform
HTTP queries to ServiceNow's TABLE or EMAIL API depending on their action.

Go to link:https://docs.servicenow.com/en-US/bundle/quebec-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/api-rest.html[ServiceNow's REST API reference, window="_blank"] for the complete API's documentation.

==== ServiceNow to ProActive

Once the application is installed, you are ready to integrate ProActive in your ServiceNow pipelines.

We will go over the core application files in the application to explain how to use them.

===== Script Includes

====== Overview

As defined by ServiceNow, Script Includes are reusable server-side scripts logic that define a function or a class.
Script Includes execute their script logic only when explicitly called by other scripts anywhere in the application where scripting is permitted.

It can be in another Script Include, In Workflow Activities, Flow Actions, UI elements ...

====== Usage

Calling a Script Include where scripting is enabled is very easy. You just need to create an instance of the Script Include and execute its functions.

Here is an example where the Script Include named SchedulerClient is called in a Flow's Action to submit a job:

[[submit_from_catalog_script_code]]
[source,javascript]
----
(function execute(inputs, outputs) {

    var schedulerClient = new SchedulerClient();
    var response = schedulerClient.submitJobFromCatalog(inputs.proactive_url, inputs.session_id, inputs.bucket_name, inputs.workflow_name, inputs.variables, inputs.generic_info);

    outputs.job_id = response.id;
    outputs.readable_name = response.readableName;

})(inputs, outputs);
----

====== ProActive's application Script Includes

There are 3 script includes in the ProActive application:

*SchedulerClient*: A client that makes REST calls to a ProActive's Scheduler.
Call this Script Include to make HTTP requests to the Scheduler of a ProActive's server.

Here is the list of its current functions.

NOTE: Functions starting with an _ is a ServiceNow naming convention for private functions. This is purely informative
as in reality they are callable from anywhere like other functions.

*OutboundRestService*: A service class that contains a utility function to execute a ServiceNow's Outbound Rest Messages.
Used by the SchedulerClient, it encapsulates the procedure to build and execute an HTTP query to ProActive's Scheduler.

Like the SchedulerClient class, its function can be called from anywhere scripting is permitted.

[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Function name | Action | Inputs | Output

This stands for all HTTP params types (including variables in the body) except query params which are defined in the following variable.
* queryParams: A JSON collection of name/value pairs which holds the name of the query param to replace and its value.
| A RESTResponseV2 object. Go to ServiceNow's link:https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/quebec/server/sn_ws-namespace/c_RESTResponseV2API[RESTResponseV2 API documentation]
to get a list of its functions.
|Cell in column 4, row 3
|===

*JobRepository*: It is the service class which holds functions to perform CRUD operations on the application's table labeled "Submitted job".
A table is a collection of records in the database. Each record corresponds to a row in a table, and each field on a record corresponds to a column on that table.
The Submitted Job table can be used to store Job Info data received from ProActive and access it in your pipelines.
Like other Script Include, it can be instantiated and called anywhere scripting is permitted.

You will find in the next section the structure of the table, which corresponds to JobInfo data fields returned by the Scheduler.

Here is the list of the current available functions

[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Function name | Action | Inputs | Output

| createSubmittedJob
| Adds a row to the Submitted Job table
a|
* sessionId: Session id of the ProActive user

| Utility function to encapsulate the update of a row process
a|
* jobId: The id of the job to be updated
| True if the update has succeeded, else false
|Cell in column 4, row 3
|===

===== Tables

The application has two tables that can be used to store and read data:

. *Submitted Job*: Each row contains data of a job submitted to the Scheduler.
This is the table used by the JobRepository Script Include to perform CRUD operations.
. *Workflow*: Each row contains a ProActive workflow xml definition file. The function submitJobFromFile of the SchedulerService Script Include
will search for the specified workflow's XML definition in this table.

Below you will find the structure of both tables

.Structure of the Submitted Job table
[cols="1,1,1"]

|Cell in column 4, row 3
|===

NOTE: All tables contain additional fields starting with sys_ . Those fields are automatically generated by ServiceNow when the table is created and can't be changed.

Two Table Columns have been added to the Incident table:

. ProActive Job Id
. ProActive Session Id

This allows to specify the sessionId of the user, and a job id at an Incident creation, binding it to a ProActive job.
Other columns can be added in the Incident table to store logs, outputs or any needed information regarding a job.

===== Flow Designer

Flow Designer is a feature for automating processes in a single design environment.

Actions and Core Actions are what composes a Flow and Subflow. The application comes with Actions ready to be used.
These Actions use the Script Includes that we described earlier.

An Action consists of:

- Inputs: Variables accessible from all steps of the action
- Action step(s): Process(es) using the provided inputs
- Outputs: Variables that represent the results of the action. These results are available to other actions in a flow.

ProActive's application Actions have been designed so that their inputs correspond to the related function called from
the Scheduler Client Script Include to make it as linear as possible.

.Available actions
[.center, cols="1", width=25%]
|===
|Action name

| Login to ProActive
| Disconnect from ProActive
| Submit job from catalog
| Submit job from file
| Wait for terminal status
| Disconnect from ProActive
|===

Here is an example with the "Submit From Catalog" action. It applies to other actions as well.

.Inputs of the Submit From Catalog action
image::servicenow-action-inputs.png[align="center"]

The Action inputs are accessible by all steps of the Action

Inputs of this step are bound to the Action inputs. This is represented by a pill
in the "Value" column.

.Inputs of the Submit From Catalog script step
image::servicenow-step-inputs.png[align="center"]

The action is composed of a single script step. A script step is JavaScript code to execute within a reusable action.
While most core actions and steps fit common use cases, a Script step enables to execute a behavior that is not satisfied by the core steps.

The code of this script step is displayed <<submit_from_catalog_script_code, here>>.

As you can see it is very simple and the execution flow consists of:

. Instantiating the SchedulerClient Script Include
. Calling the submitFromCatalog function with the inputs as parameters
. Writing the result in the outputs variable

Finally, we define the outputs of the action with the same pills system, binding them to the step outputs.

.Outputs of the Submit From Catalog Action
image::servicenow-action-outputs.png[align="center"]

The concept is the same for all the application's Actions.

===== Flows

To put it simply, a flow is an automated process consisting of a sequence of actions and a trigger.
Flow building takes place in the Flow Designer application which requires a paid subscription to the Integration Hub application.

A Flow consists of the content types:

- Subflows: A Subflow is an automated process consisting of a sequence of reusable actions and specific data inputs that allow the process to be started from a flow, subflow, or script.
- Actions: An Action is a reusable operation that enables process analysts to automate Now Platform features without having to write code
- Core Actions: A ServiceNow Core Action is a ServiceNow-provided action available to any flow that cannot be viewed or edited from the Action Designer design environment.
For example, the Ask for Approval action

A trigger identifies what causes the flow to execute. +

Flows are triggered by:

- Record creation and/or update
- Date
- Service Catalog request
- Inbound email
- Service Level Agreements
- MetricBase (requires the MetricBase plugin)

NOTE: To access Flows, a user must have the flow_designer or admin roles.

The ProActive application come with Flows that can:

- Submit a job from the catalog asynchronously
- Restart in error tasks

Below is the "Submit job from catalog async" Flow

image::servicenow-flow.png[align="center"]

This Flow submits a job to ProActive's Scheduler in parallel, thus not blocking the main Flow thread.

In the Right panel named Data, you will find the data flow of the Flow. It offers a quick view of the Flow variables, accessible by all actions
and the inputs for each Action. Fo convenience, it has been cut in half in this screenshot.

image::servicenow-data-flow-flow-designer.png[align="center"]

The flow needs a trigger definition, and it will ready to run.

===== Workflows

The second way to automate complex processes is using Workflows that are built in the Workflow Editor.
A Workflow is the native way to do automation in ServiceNow. Workflow editor is intended for a more technical audience.

The goal and concepts of Workflows are the same as Flows only with a different interface and terminology.

Like Actions for Flows, a Workflow is a suite of Activities used for automating the processes.
Activities are the workflow blocks that carry out various tasks like sending emails, obtaining approvals, running scripts, and configuring field values on the records.

Every workflow starts with a Begin activity and ends with an End activity.
When the activity ends, the activity is available through the suitable node and the transition is comprehended to the latter activity.

Following are the ways to launch Workflows:

- UI Action
- Server-side script
- Triggered by field values on a record

The ProActive application comes with a set of activities ready to be used in your workflows.
Like the Actions in the Flows, they call the application's Script Include to perform their actions.

Each activity likely have inputs that needs to be defined.

Here the Login activity will read variables defined in the workflow's scratchpad.

image::servicenow-activity-variables.png[align="center"]

This window automatically opens when the activity is dragged and dropped on the canvas.

Use ProActive's custom activities from the Custom tab to integrate ProActive in your pipelines.

Here an example of a simple Workflow, that can be stored and used as a Sub Workflow, that Submits a job to ProActive from the Catalog

image::servicenow-workflow-example.png[align="center"]
