The `data-connectors` bucket contains diverse generic data connectors for the most frequently used data storage systems (File, SQL, NoSQL, Cloud, ERP). The aim of a data connector is to facilitate and simplify data access from your workflows to external data sources.

=== File
The File connectors allow to import and export data from HTTP, FTP and SFTP servers.
We begin by presenting FTP and SFTP connectors then, URL connector.

==== FTP and SFTP connectors


The FTP and SFTP file connector workflows consists of two tasks:

* Import_from_FTP/SFTP_Server: Downloads files or folders recursively from an FTP/SFTP server to the data space.
* Export_to_FTP/SFTP_Server: Uploads files or folders recursively from the data space (global or user space) to an FTP/SFTP server.

*Variables:*

The FTP and SFTP workflow tasks share the same list of variables. Consequently, we describe them in the following table using a unique notation.

.FTP/SFTP Connector variables

=== SQL
In this part, we first present the data connector tasks that allow users to access and manipulate data of the most frequently used databases,
then we show how to use pooled connection to SQL databases across multiple task executions.

==== Data Connectors
The data connectors allow to import and export data from and to Relational DataBase Management Systems (RDBMS).
Currently, we have connectors for MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Greenplum and SQL Server.

All SQL connector workflows are composed of two tasks:

* Import_from_<Database>: Import data from an SQL database server to be processed in the same workflow or just to be stored as a csv file in the data space.
* Export_to_<Database>: Export data from the data space (global or user space) to an SQL database server.

where Database âˆˆ {MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Greenplum and SQL Server}

*Variables:*

All SQL connectors share the same list of variables. Consequently, we describe them in the following table using a unique notation.

.SQL Connector variables
[cols="2,5,2,2,2,2"]
|===
| *Variable name* | *Description* | *Scope* | *Required?*  | *Type*  | *Default/Examples*

| Export Task
| Yes
| String
| Default: `append`
| `INPUT_FILE`
| - It can be a relative path in the dataspace of a csv file containing the data to import.

| Export Task
| Yes
| String
| e.g. `path/to/data.csv` or
\http://link/to/my/data/csv
|===

*How to use this task:*

When you drag & drop an SQL connector, two tasks will be appended to your workflow: an import task and an export task. Each task can be used as a separate component in an ETL pipeline; thus, you can keep one of them depending on your needs and remove the other or you can use them both.

The task requires the following third-party credential:

{key: `<mysql|postgresql|sqlserver|oracle|greenplum>://<<USER>@<<HOST>:<<PORT>`, value: `<RDBMS_NAME>_PASSWORD`}.

_e.g._ +
|===
| key | value

a| `mysql://myuser@localhost:1234`
a| your `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
a| `sqlserver://anotheruser@10.0.0.1:5432`
a| your `SQLSERVER_PASSWORD`

|===


This is a one-time action and will ensure that your credentials are securely encrypted. Please refer to the User documentation to learn how to add link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_third_party_credentials[third-party credentials].

In the import mode, the output containing the imported data takes one or many of the following forms:

* in a _CSV_ format to saved to:
 ** the `OUTPUT_FILE` in the data space if specified by the user
 ** _and_ to the `result` variable to make is previewable in the scheduler portal and to make it accessible for the next tasks.
* in a _JSON_ format using the variable `DATAFRAME_JSON`.

==== Database Connections Pooling
To allow the persistence of a single connection across multiple SQL tasks (basically when running several tasks concurrently on the same machine),
we have implemented the connection pooling feature to any external SQL database based on the https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP[HikariCP^] Framework.
This feature is demonstrated through two workflow templates: SQL_Pooled_Connection_Query and SQL_Pooled_Connection_Update. Both are single-task workflows.

*Variables:*

The variables listed in the following table exist for both SQL_Pooled_Connection_Update and SQL_Pooled_Connection_Query workflows.

.Workflows' variables
[cols="2,5,2,2,2,3"]
|===
| *Variable name* | *Description* | *Scope* | *Required?*  | *Type*  | *Default/Examples*

| HikariCP framework provides many data source properties that can be used to configure the DB pooled connection such as autoCommit, maximumPoolSize, maxLifetime, idleTimeout .... You can add as many properties as you want. For each one, please add a new task variable where the variable name is the property name having "POOL_"  as a prefix and the variable value is the property value. For more info, please refer to https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP.
| Workflow, Task
| No
| String
| e.g. POOL_autoCommit, POOL_maximumPoolSize
| `SQL_STATEMENTS`
| To change or update data, you have to use CREATE, INSERT , UPDATE , or DELETE statements. To query data, you have to perform SELECT statements.
| Workflow, Task
| Yes
| String
| e.g. ```SELECT * FROM ...```, ```DROP TABLE ...```
|===

In addition to the aforementioned variables, SQL_Pooled_Connection_Query workflow has two more variables.

.SQL_Pooled_Connection_Query additional variables
[cols="2,5,2,2,2,3"]
|===
| *Variable name* | *Description* | *Scope* | *Required?*  | *Type*  | *Default/Examples*
| `OUTPUT_TYPE`
| If set to `HTML`, it allows to preview the results in the Scheduler Portal in a HTML format. If set to `CSV`, it allows to download the results from the Scheduler Portal in a CSV format.

| Yes
| String
| Values: `{CSV, HTML}`.

Default: `HTML`
| `STORE_RESULT_VARIABLE`
| if not empty, the value will be the name of a variable that contains the resultSet of the query (converted into a List of Maps). This variable can be used in other tasks.
| Workflow, Task
| No
| String
| Values: `{CSV, HTML}`.

Default: `HTML`
|===

*How to use these workflows:*

The scheduler should be configured in non-fork mode to execute tasks in a single JVM rather than starting a dedicated JVM to run the task (In $PROACTIVE_HOME/config/scheduler/settings.ini, set pa.scheduler.task.fork=false).

Data connectors workflows may need to add some third-party dependencies to their classpath (notably, JDBC jar libraries), so they can be executed properly. Please refer to the Admin guide documentation to learn how to add link:../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.html#__add_custom_third_party_libraries_to_proactive_server_and_nodes_classpath].

In case the password is required, you have to add the following third-party credential: {key: `<mysql|postgresql|sqlserver|oracle|hsqldb:hsql>://<USERNAME>@<HOST>:<PORT>`, value: `<RDBMS_NAME>_PASSWORD`}. This is a one-time action and will ensure that your credentials are securely encrypted. Please refer to the User guide documentation to learn how to add link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_third_party_credentials[third-party credentials].

By default, if `AZ_T` is set, the tasks will attempt to connect through a service principal.

[NOTE]
====
.The Output File
* Instead of hardcoding the name of your output file in your U-SQL script, you can use the placeholder `OUTPUT_FILE`, which is automatically replaced by the value of `AZ_DLA_OUTPUT`.
* Once downloaded, the output file will be stored in your *User Space* (and _not_ in the Global Space).
* You can visualize a table-like version of your output data in the _Preview_ tab of the Display_result task.

*How to use these tasks:*

When you drag & drop a Snowflake connector, two tasks will be appended to your workflow: an import task and an export task. Each task can be used as a separate component in an ETL pipeline; thus, you can keep one of them depending on your needs and remove the other or you can use them both.

Each task requires the following third-party credential:

{key: `<snowflake>://<<USER>@<<ACCOUNT>:<<WAREHOUSE>`, value: `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`}.


=== ERP

ProActive's ERP connectors enable communication and data exchange with popular ERP software providers.

==== SAP ECC

This connector allows you to interact with an SAP ECC system (not S/4HANA) by means of Remote Function Calls (RFC).

*Variables:*

.SAP ECC Connector variables
[cols="2,5,2,2,2,2"]
|===
| *Variable name* | *Description* | *Scope* | *Required?* | *Type*  | *Default/Examples*
| `JCO_ FUNCTION`
| The name of a remote-enabled function module on your SAP System. You can verify the available functions in your ECC transaction SE37.
| Workflow
| Yes
| String
| e.g. RFC_SYSTEM_INFO
|===

*How to use this connector:*

In order to securely connect to your SAP ECC system, you first need to store your SAP logon information as ProActive's link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_third_party_credentials[third-party credentials]. The required credentials are:

.SAP connection credentials
[cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| *Credential* | *Description* | *Example*
| `JCO_ASHOST`
| Application server host IP.
| 10.10.10.1
| `JCO_SYSNR`
| System number.
| 00
| `JCO_CLIENT`
| Client number.
| 100
| `JCO_USER`
| SAP logon user name.
| myuser
| `JCO_PASSWD`
| SAP logon password (it will be hidden).
| mypassword
| `JCO_LANG`
| Preferred language.
| EN
| `JCO_SAPROUTER`
| _(Optional)_ An SAP Router string, in case you are connecting from an external
               network. It is important that you keep the /H/ tags.
| /H/192.168.0.1/H/
|===

Once the credentials are set, the workflow can be executed. If the connection is successful, the connection attributes will be listed as output. *NB.* ProActive's SAP connector provides libraries to connect to an SAP server from a 64-bit OS (Windows, Linux, MacOS); libraries for other OS can be obtained through SAP Marketplace.

.Querying for a function
The SAP connector will search for the function module provided as the `JCO_FUNCTION` variable. If the function module exists and is remote-enabled, the script will display the function's parameters (import, export, tables) right after the Connection attributes.

.Executing a function
The SAP connector includes an example of how to execute and handle the result of a function using the default `RFC_SYSTEM_INFO`, which returns a structure containing the System's information. After the function is executed, the result can be accessed through the method `getExportParameterList()`.

[source,groovy]
----
// execute RFC_SYSTEM_INFO function
sapFunction.execute(destination)
// obtain structure RFCSI_EXPORT
JCoStructure structure = sapFunction.getExportParameterList().getStructure("RFCSI_EXPORT")
if (structure != null) {
  println("System info:")
  // loop on structure to get the info
  for(JCoField field : structure) {
    println(field.getName() + " : " + field.getString())
  }
}
----
