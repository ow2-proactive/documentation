The `data-connectors` bucket contains diverse generic data connectors for the most frequently used data storage systems (File, SQL, NoSQL, Cloud, ERP). The aim of a data connector is to facilitate and simplify importing data from external sources into your workflows.

=== File
The File connectors allow to import and export data from HTTP, FTP and SFTP servers.
We begin by presenting FTP and SFTP connectors then, URL connector.

==== FTP and SFTP connectors

*Variables:*
The FTP and SFTP connectors share the same list of variables. Consequently, we describe them in the following table using a unique notation.
`<PROTOCOL>` can take one of the following values: {`FTP`, `SFTP`}

.FTP/SFTP Connector variables
[cols="2,5,2,2,2,2"]
|===
| *Variable name* | *Description* | *Level* | *Required?*  | *Type*  | *Default/Examples*
| `<PROTOCOL>_HOSTNAME`
| IP address of the server host.
| Workflow, Task
| Yes
| String
| `localhost`
| `<PROTOCOL>_PORT`
| Listening port.
| Workflow, Task
| No
| Integer
| e.g. 21, 22
| `<PROTOCOL>_LOCAL_RELATIVE_PATH`
| Local `relative` path from which we upload (or to which we download) file(s).
It can contain either a path to a file, a directory terminated by `/` or an empty value for the root.
| Workflow, Task
| No
| String
| e.g. localDirectory/, example.zip
| `<PROTOCOL>_REMOTE_RELATIVE_PATH`
| Remote `relative` path to which we upload (or from which we download) file(s).
| Workflow, Task
| Yes
| String
| e.g. remoteDirectory/, test.txt
| `<PROTOCOL>_MODE`
| Transfer mode.
| Workflow, Task
| Yes
| PA:LIST(GET, PUT)
| GET
| `<PROTOCOL>_EXTRACT_ARCHIVE`
| Used only when `<PROTOCOL>_MODE=GET`. If set to `true`, the imported file will be extracted if it is an archive.
| Workflow, Task
| Yes
|  Boolean [true or false]
| false
| `<PROTOCOL>_USERNAME`
| Username to use for the authentication.
| Workflow, Task
| Yes
|  String
| e.g. \ftp://someuser@example.com
|===

*How to use this task:* The task requires the following third-party credential: `{key: <PROTOCOL>://<username>@<hostname>, value: <PROTOCOL>_PASSWORD}`. Please refer to the User documentation to learn how to add link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_third_party_credentials[third-party credentials].

==== URL connector

The URL connector allows, in addition, to import data using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

*Variables:*

.URL Connector variables
[cols="2,5,2,2,2,2"]
|===
| *Variable name* | *Description* | *Level* | *Required?*  | *Type*  | *Default/Examples*
| `FILE_URL`
| Link to a file accessible using HTTP, HTTPS, SFTP or FTP protocols.

  FTP and SFTP urls must have the following patterns:

- `\ftp://<username>[:<password>]@<hostname>[:<port>]/<relativePath>`

- `sftp://<username>[:<password>]@<hostname>[:<port>]/<relativePath>`

| Task
| Yes
| String
| e.g. sftp://user:pass@example.com/test.txt
| `FTP_LOCAL_RELATIVE_PATH`
|  Local relative path from which we upload (or to which we download) file(s).
  LOCAL_RELATIVE_PATH can contain either a path to a file, a directory terminated by `/` or an empty value for the root.
| Task
| No
| String
| e.g. localDirectory/, example.zip
| `EXTRACT_ARCHIVE`
| If set to `true`, the imported file will be extracted if it is an archive.
| Task
| Yes
| Boolean [true or false]
| false
|===

*How to use this task:* We highly recommend the user to not provide his password within the URL and to instead use the third-party credential mechanism as follows: `{key: <PROTOCOL>://<username>@<hostname>, value: <PROTOCOL>_PASSWORD}`. Please refer to the User documentation to learn how to add link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_third_party_credentials[third-party credentials].

=== SQL
The SQL connectors allow to import data from Relational DataBase Management Systems (RDBMS).
Currently, we have connectors for Mysql, Oracle, Postgres and Sql server.

*Variables:*
All SQL connectors share the same list of variables. Consequently, we describe them in the following table using a unique notation.
`<RDBMS_NAME>` can take one of the following values: {`POSTGRES`, `ORACLE`, `SQL_SERVER`, `MYSQL`}

.SQL Connector variables
[cols="2,5,2,2,2,2"]
|===
| *Variable name* | *Description* | *Level* | *Required?*  | *Type*  | *Default/Examples*
| `<RDBMS_NAME>_HOSTNAME`
| Label or the IP address of the server hosting the database.
| Workflow
| Yes
| String
| `localhost`
| `<RDBMS_NAME>_PORT`
| Listening port.
| Workflow
| No
| Integer
| e.g. 5432, 1521
| `<RDBMS_NAME>_DATABASE`
| Database name.
| Workflow
| Yes
| String
| e.g. activeeon
| `<RDBMS_NAME>_QUERY`
| Requires an SQL query or a table name to fetch data from.
| Workflow, Task
| Yes
| String
| e.g. select * from users
| `LABEL`
| Used when the imported data is labeled. Then, the user can specify the label column name.
| Task
| No
| String
| e.g. class
| `<RDBMS_NAME>_RMDB_DRIVER`
| The driver to connect to the database.
| Task
| Yes
| String
| e.g. cx_oracle, psycopg2
|===

*How to use this task:* This task uses the driver given in `RMDB_DRIVER` to connect to the database. To use another driver, make sure you have it properly installed before (e.g. using `pip install <RMDBS_DRIVER>`).
The task requires the following third-party credentials: `<RDBMS_NAME>_USERNAME` and `<RDBMS_NAME>_PASSWORD`. Please refer to the User documentation to learn how to add link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_third_party_credentials[third-party credentials].
The imported data is exported in a JSON format using the variable `DATAFRAME_JSON`.

=== NoSQL
The NoSQL connectors allow to import data from NoSQL Databases.
Currently, we have connectors for MongoDB and Cassandra.

*Variables:*

`<NoSQL_NAME>` can take one of the following values: {`CASSANDRA`, `MONGODB`}

.NoSQL Connector variables
[cols="2,5,2,2,2,2"]
|===
| *Variable name* | *Description* | *Level* | *Required?*  | *Type*  | *Default/Examples*
| `<NoSQL_NAME>_HOSTNAME`
| Label or the IP address of the server hosting the database.
| Workflow
| Yes
| String
| `localhost`
| `<NoSQL_NAME>_PORT`
| Listening port.
| Workflow
| No
| Integer
| e.g. 27018, 9042
| `MONGODB_DATABASE` or `CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE`
| Equivalent to the database name.
| Workflow
| Yes
| String
| e.g. activeeon
| `<NoSQL_NAME>_QUERY`
| Requires a NoSQL query to fetch data.
| Workflow, Task
| No (depends on the NoSQL database)
| String
| e.g. {"class":2}
| `MONGODB_COLLECTION`
| Equivalent to a `table` in a RDBMS.
| Workflow, Task
| Yes
| String
| e.g. users
| `LABEL`
| Used when the imported data is labeled. Then, the user can specify the label column name.
| Task
| No
| String
| e.g. class
| `NOSQL_DRIVER`
| The driver to connect to MongoDB.
| Task
| Yes
| String
| e.g. pymongo
|===

*How to use this task:* This task uses the driver given in `NOSQL_DRIVER` to connect to MongoDB. To use another driver, make sure you have it properly installed before.  (e.g. using `pip install <NOSQL_DRIVER>`).
The task requires the following third-party credentials: `<NoSQL_NAME>_USERNAME` and `<NoSQL_NAME>_PASSWORD`. Please refer to the User documentation to learn how to add link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_third_party_credentials[third-party credentials].
The imported data is exported in a JSON format using the variable `DATAFRAME_JSON`.
