The `data-connectors` bucket contains diverse generic data connectors for the most frequently used data storage systems (File, SQL, NoSQL, Cloud, ERP). The aim of a data connector is to facilitate and simplify data access from your workflows to external data sources.

=== File
The File connectors allow to import and export data from HTTP, FTP and SFTP servers.
We begin by presenting FTP and SFTP connectors then, URL connector.

==== FTP and SFTP connectors


The FTP and SFTP file connector workflows consists of two tasks:

* Import_from_FTP/SFTP_Server: Downloads files or folders recursively from an FTP/SFTP server to the data space.
* Export_to_FTP/SFTP_Serve: Uploads files or folders recursively from the data space (global or user space) to an FTP/SFTP server.

*Variables:*

The FTP and SFTP workflow tasks share the same list of variables. Consequently, we describe them in the following table using a unique notation.

Currently, we have connectors for MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Greenplum and SQL Server.

SQL connectors workflows are composed of two tasks: an import task and an export task.

*Variables:*

All SQL connectors share the same list of variables. Consequently, we describe them in the following table using a unique notation.
`<RDBMS_NAME>` can take one of the following values: {`POSTGRES`, `GPDB`, `ORACLE`, `SQL_SERVER`, `MYSQL`}

|===

*How to use this task:*

When you drag & drop an SQL connector, two tasks will be appended to your workflow: an import task and an export task. You can keep one of them depending on your needs and remove the other or you can use them both.

This task uses the driver given in `RMDB_DRIVER` to connect to the database. To use another driver, make sure you have it properly installed before (e.g. using `pip install <RMDBS_DRIVER>`).

The task requires the following third-party credential: {key: `<mysql|postgres|mssql|oracle|gpdb>://<<RDBMS_NAME>_USER>@<<RDBMS_NAME>_HOST>:<<RDBMS_NAME>_PORT>`, value: `<RDBMS_NAME>_PASSWORD`}. ; this is a one-time action and will ensure that your credentials are securely encrypted. Please refer to the User documentation to learn how to add link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_third_party_credentials[third-party credentials].

In the import mode, the output containing the imported data takes one or many of the following forms:

* in a _CSV_ format to saved to:
 ** the `<RDBMS_NAME>_OUTPUT_FILE` in the data space if specified by the user
 ** _and_ to the `result` variable to make is previewable in the scheduler portal and to make it accessible for the next tasks.
* in a _JSON_ format using the variable `DATAFRAME_JSON`.

Azure Data Lake tasks require your Azure login credentials to be set as third-party credentials (`key:value` pairs); this is a one-time action and will ensure that your credentials are securely encrypted. Please refer to the User documentation to learn how to add link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_third_party_credentials[third-party credentials].

You have two options for providing your login credentials:

* Standard Azure login: `AZ_U:your_user` (usually an email). `AZ_P:your_password`.
* Using an link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?toc=%2Fazure%2Fazure-resource-manager%2Ftoc.json&view=azure-cli-latest[Azure service principal]: `AZ_U:appId`. `AZ_P:password`. `AZ_T:tenant`. By default, if `AZ_T` is set, the tasks will attempt to connect through a service principal.

[NOTE]
====
.The Output File
* Instead of hardcoding the name of your output file in your U-SQL script, you can use the placeholder `OUTPUT_FILE`, which is automatically replaced by the value of `AZ_DLA_OUTPUT`.
* Once downloaded, the output file will be stored in your *User Space* (and _not_ in the Global Space).
* You can visualize a table-like version of your output data in the _Preview_ tab of the Display_result task.

|===

*How to use this connector:*

In order to securely connect to your SAP ECC system, you first need to store your SAP logon information as ProActive's link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_third_party_credentials[third-party credentials]. The required credentials are:

.SAP connection credentials
[cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| *Credential* | *Description* | *Example*
| `JCO_ASHOST`
| Application server host IP.
| 10.10.10.1
| `JCO_SYSNR`
| System number.
| 00
| `JCO_CLIENT`
| Client number.
| 100
| `JCO_USER`
| SAP logon user name.
| myuser
| `JCO_PASSWD`
| SAP logon password (it will be hidden).
| mypassword
| `JCO_LANG`
| Preferred language.
| EN
| `JCO_SAPROUTER`
| _(Optional)_ An SAP Router string, in case you are connecting from an external
               network. It is important that you keep the /H/ tags.
| /H/192.168.0.1/H/
|===

Once the credentials are set, the workflow can be executed. If the connection is successful, the connection attributes will be listed as output. *NB.* Proactive's SAP connector provides libraries to connect to an SAP server from a 64-bit OS (Windows, Linux, MacOS); libraries for other OS can be obtained through SAP Marketplace.

.Querying for a function
The SAP connector will search for the function module provided as the `JCO_FUNCTION` variable. If the function module exists and is remote-enabled, the script will display the function's parameters (import, export, tables) right after the Connection attributes.

.Executing a function
The SAP connector includes an example of how to execute and handle the result of a function using the default `RFC_SYSTEM_INFO`, which returns a structure containing the System's information. After the function is executed, the result can be accessed through the method `getExportParameterList()`.

[source,groovy]
----
// execute RFC_SYSTEM_INFO function
sapFunction.execute(destination)
// obtain structure RFCSI_EXPORT
JCoStructure structure = sapFunction.getExportParameterList().getStructure("RFCSI_EXPORT")
if (structure != null) {
  println("System info:")
  // loop on structure to get the info
  for(JCoField field : structure) {
    println(field.getName() + " : " + field.getString())
  }
}
----

For a more detailed guide of ProActive's SAP ECC connector, please refer to link:https://www.activeeon.com/resources/SAPConnector.pdf[this document].

Further information and examples using the SAP JCO library are available in the link:https://help.hana.ondemand.com/javadoc/index.html[SAP Cloud Platform SDK Documentation] and the SAP Java Connector documentation, accessible through link:https://websmp201.sap-ag.de/[SAP Service Marketplace].
