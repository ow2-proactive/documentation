=== Overview

The <<_glossary_notification_portal,*Notification Portal*>> allows users to subscribe, be notified and react when different
types of events occur during <<_glossary_job,*Job*>> execution, on the state of the <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler,*ProActive Scheduler*>> or when
automating and scheduling jobs with the <<_glossary_job_planner,*Job Planner*>>.

=== Subscriptions

==== Principle

A notification <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscription*>> consists in a set of events selected by a user for a particular service,
a type of workflows or a specific workflow.

Event reception is configurable and allows portal notifications, email sending and custom script execution.

A user creating a subscription will need to:

- Select one of the subscription types
- Select one or more events from a predefined list that user will be notified of.
- Activate one or more <<_glossary_notification_methods,*Notification Methods*>>.

==== Subscription types

There are three types of <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscriptions*>>:

- Service subscriptions.
- Job subscriptions.
- Channel subscriptions.

===== Service subscriptions

Service subscriptions are unique for each service they are associated to and created by default for every user.
It enables to subscribe to events that may occur on a particular service like the <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler,*ProActive Scheduler*>>
or the <<_glossary_job_planner,*Job Planner*>>.

Service subscriptions are deactivated by default, to start receiving notifications users only needs to:

- Activate one or more <<_glossary_notification_methods,*Notification Methods*>>.
- Select desired events
- Activate the <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscription*>>.

[title="Example with job planner subscription"]

To modify a service subscription simply click on it and do your adjustments. The subscription is automatically saved.

===== Job subscriptions

Job subscriptions must be defined and created in order to receive notifications.
Users can have multiple job subscriptions with different granularity on the workflows they are associated to.

At least one field of <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflow*>> data must be provided to create the subscription, that means it
is not possible to create a job subscription that will listen for all jobs submitted to the Scheduler.

[title="Workflow data to create a job subscription"]
image::job-subscription-workflow-data.png[align="center"]

Two scenarios are possible when creating a job subscription:

- If a bucket name only is set, then the user will be notified for all <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflows*>> of the specified bucket.
- Otherwise there has to be an exact match between the bucket name, project name and workflow name of the workflow you wish to be notified of
and the associated subscription.

To create a job subscription, go to the <<_glossary_notification_portal,*Notification Portal*>>,
job subscriptions tab and click on the _+_ button

[title="Button to create a job subscription"]
image::job-subscriptions-summary.png[align="center"]

Then fill and select the mandatory fields and click on _Save_

[title="Job subscription creation"]
image::job-subscription-creation.png[align="center"]

The _Submitted by_ switch may be activated to be notified of events for job submitted only by the user who created the subscription.

To modify a job subscription simply click on it, do your adjustments and save it.

[[channels_subscription]]
===== Channel subscriptions

Like service subscriptions, channel subscriptions are unique to each user. It allows users to subscribe to channels created beforehand.
A user that is a notification service administrator can subscribe to any channel.
Otherwise, a user can subscribe to:

- A public channel (a channel authorized for all groups).
- A channel whose group authorization matches one of the user groups.

To visualize past notifications and start receiving new ones, a user must update his channel subscription with the following actions:

- Activate a notification method for the channel subscription.
- Select desired channels from the user's available channels list
- Finally, activate the subscription.

[title="Channel subscription"]
image::channel-sub.png[align="center"]

Go to the <<channels_section,*Channel section*>> to learn more about channels.

==== Notification methods

To define the way to be notified, a user must select at least one notification method.
It is mandatory to have at least one active notification method in order to create or update a subscription.

There are three notification methods available

- "Portal": The notification will be displayed in the <<_glossary_notification_portal,*Notification Portal*>>.

- "Email": The notification will be sent by email.
In order to use this method, the SMTP settings must be defined in the dedicated configuration file, inside the ProActive server.
Please refer to the corresponding link:../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.html#_email_notification_method[Email notification configuration] section in the administration guide.

- "Third-party": To trigger a script execution. It also requires configuration to specify the location of the script,
or optional options such as multiple script execution.
Go to the link:../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.html#_third_party_notification_method[Third party notification method]
section in the Admin guide to look at the full configuration.

===== Notification Method confirmation

An administrator can activate confirmation request for notification methods other than portal.
In such case, after providing the notification method parameter (Email, Third-party parameter, Telephone)
, an input field will appear below the parameter asking for a confirmation code.
It is also possible to resend from there a confirmation code in case it hasn't been received
, or if it has exceeded its 15 minutes life span and is now expired.

[title="Code confirmation request"]
image::confirmation-request.png[align="center"]

- "Email": An email will be sent to the provided address with the confirmation code in the body.
- "Third-party": An execution will occur with the confirmation code in the accessible MESSAGE script field.

For notification methods which parameters are mandatory (ie: Email), the user may go to his subscriptions
and activate the notification method to start receiving notification by this mean once the parameter is confirmed.

If a notification method parameter is deleted or changed and reused in the future, then a new confirmation
request will be triggered.

[[channels_section]]
=== Channels

==== Principle

A notification service <<_glossary_notification_channel, Channel>> is a centralized space in the <<_glossary_notification_portal, Notification Portal>>
for groups of users to receive notifications created from a workflow using the `Channel_Notification` task.
It consists of a unique name and a set of user groups authorized to subscribe to the channel.

In order to receive channel notifications, it is required to create one or more channels and update the
<<channels_subscription,*Channel subscription*>> to specify which channels we wish to be notified of.

==== Rules

- Unlike other notifications, channel notifications are retroactive. It means that when a user subscribes to a channel that already had notifications
, they will appear to the user.
- Channel notifications cannot be deleted, the link:../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.html#_notification_housekeeping[Housekeeping]
takes care of it once their life span is exceeded.
- Notification service administrators can subscribe to any channels. Other users must be part of at least one of the authorized groups
defined in the channel in order to subscribe to a channel, unless all groups are authorized (public channels).

==== Channel Creation

All users are able to create channels for any group. It is required to provide a unique channel name and a list of groups
which will be authorized to subscribe to the channel.

It can either be authorized for all groups, a subset of the channel owner groups, or any free input.

[title="Channel creation"]
image::create-channel.png[align="center"]

==== Channel Management

Channel management is where users can update channels by modifying a channel's name, add or remove authorized groups or delete it.

A notification service administrator is able to update any channels, whether he is the creator of the channel or not.
Other users can update only channels that they have created.

To update a channel's name or authorized groups, simply make the update and click on the __Save__ button.

To delete a channel, click on the __Bin__ icon on the left of the channel definition.

[title="Channel management"]
image::channel-management.png[align="center"]

==== Channel Notification

In order to send a channel notification, a user must append the `Channel_Notification` task to a <<_glossary_workflow, Workflow>>.

The notification's message, severity and notified groups are configurable by the user in the `Channel_Notification`.
Simply update the following *Task variables* values to do so.

[title="Channel_Notification task variables"]
image::channel-notif-task-variables.png[align="center"]

- *MESSAGE:* The message that will be displayed to the notified users. This variable is a free input
and cannot be empty.
- *SEVERITY:* Users can define the notification's severity by updating this variable. Available severities are
INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL. The default severity is INFO.
- *CHANNELS:* channels that will be notified. It can be a single channel, a comma separated list of channels, or the `All` keyword.

`All` (default) means:
- For a notification-service administrator, send a notification to all channels
- For a standard user, send a notification to all authorized channels (the user belongs to an authorized group of these channels).
