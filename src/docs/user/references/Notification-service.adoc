=== Overview

The <<_glossary_notification_portal,*Notification Portal*>> allows users to subscribe, be notified and react when different
types of events occur during <<_glossary_job,*Job*>> execution, on the state of the <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler,*ProActive Scheduler*>> or when
automating and scheduling jobs with the <<_glossary_job_planner,*Job Planner*>>.

=== Subscriptions

==== Principle

A notification <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscription*>> consists in a set of events selected by a user for a particular service,
a type of workflows or a specific workflow.

Event reception is configurable and allows portal notifications, email sending and custom script execution.

A user creating a subscription will need to:

- Select one of the subscription types
- Select one or more events from a predefined list that user will be notified of.
- Activate one or more <<_glossary_notification_methods,*Notification Methods*>>.

==== Subscription types

There are two types of <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscriptions*>>:

- Service subscriptions.
- Job subscriptions.

===== Service subscriptions

Service subscriptions are unique for each service they are associated to and created by default for every user.
It enables to subscribe to events that may occur on a particular service like the <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler,*ProActive Scheduler*>>
or the <<_glossary_job_planner,*Job Planner*>>.

Service subscriptions are deactivated by default, to start receiving notifications users only needs to:

- Activate one or more <<_glossary_notification_methods,*Notification Methods*>>.
- Select desired events
- Activate the <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscription*>>.

To modify a service subscription simply click on it and do your adjustments. The subscription is automatically saved.

===== Job subscriptions

Job subscriptions must be defined and created in order to receive notifications.
Users can have multiple job subscriptions with different granularity on the workflows they are associated to.

At least one field of <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflow*>> data must be provided to create the subscription, that means it
is not possible to create a job subscription that will listen for all jobs submitted to the Scheduler.

[title="Workflow data to create a job subscription"]
image::job-subscription-workflow-data.png[align="center"]

Two scenarios are possible when creating a job subscription:

- If a bucket name only is set, then the user will be notified for all <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflows*>> of the specified bucket.
- Otherwise there has to be an exact match between the bucket name, project name and workflow name of the workflow you wish to be notified of
and the associated subscription.

To create a job subscription, go to the <<_glossary_notification_portal,*Notification Portal*>>,
job subscriptions tab and click on the _+_ button

[title="Button to create a job subscription"]

Then fill and select the mandatory fields and click on _Save_

[title="Job subscription creation"]

The _Submitted by_ switch may be activated to be notified of events for job submitted only by the user who created the subscription.

To modify a job subscription simply click on it, do your adjustments and save it.

==== Notification methods

To define the way to be notified, a user must select at least one notification method.
It is mandatory to have at least one active notification method in order to create or update a subscription.

There are three notification methods available

- "Portal": The notification will be displayed in the <<_glossary_notification_portal,*Notification Portal*>>.

- "Email": The notification will be sent by email.
In order to use this method, the SMTP settings must be defined in the dedicated configuration file, inside the ProActive server.
Please refer to the corresponding link:../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.html#_email_notification_method[Email notification configuration] section in the administration guide.

- "Third-party": To trigger a script execution. It also requires configuration to specify the location of the script,
or optional options such as multiple script execution.
Go to the link:../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.html#_third_party_notification_method[Third party notification method]
section in the Admin guide to look at the full configuration.

===== Notification Method confirmation

An administrator can activate confirmation request for notification methods other than portal.
In such case, after providing the notification method parameter (Email, Third-party parameter, Telephone)
an input field will appear bellow the parameter asking for a confirmation code.
It is also possible from there to resend a confirmation code in case it hasn't been received
or if it has exceeded his 15 minutes life span and is now expired.

[title="Code confirmation request"]
image::confirmation-request.png[align="center"]

- "Email": An email will be sent to the provided address with the confirmation code in the body.
- "Third-party": An execution will occur with the confirmation code in the accessible MESSAGE script field.

For notification methods which parameters are mandatory (ie: Email), the user may go to his subscriptions
and activate the notification method to start receiving notification by this mean once the parameter is confirmed.

If a notification method parameter is deleted or changed and reused in the future, then a new confirmation
request will be triggered.
