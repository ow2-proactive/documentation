== Get started

To submit your first computation to *ProActive Scheduler*, link:../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.html#_getting_started[install] it in
your environment (default credentials: admin/admin) or just use our demo platform http://try.activeeon.com[try.activeeon.com^].

*ProActive Scheduler* provides comprehensive interfaces that allow to:

- http://try.activeeon.com/studio[Create workflows^]
- http://try.activeeon.com/scheduler[Submit workflows, monitor their execution and retrieve the tasks results^]
- http://try.activeeon.com/rm[Add resources and monitor them^]

We also provide REST and command line interfaces for advanced users.

== Create and run your computation

=== Jobs, workflows and tasks

In order to use Scheduler for executing various computations, one needs to write the execution definition
also known as the Workflow definition. A workflow definition is an XML file that adheres to
<<_job_and_task_specification,XML schema for ProActive Workflows>>.

It specifies a number of XML tags for specifying execution steps, their sequence and dependencies.
Each execution step corresponds to a task which is the smallest unit of execution that can be performed on a
 computation resources. There are several types of tasks which caters different use cases.

*ProActive Scheduler* currently supports three main types of tasks:

- *Native Task*, an executable with eventual parameters to be executed
- *Script Task*, a script written in Groovy, Ruby, Python and other languages supported by the JSR-223
- *Java Task*, a task written in Java extending the Scheduler API

WARNING: We strongly recommend to use script tasks that are more flexible rather than Java tasks.
You can easily integrate with any Java code from a Groovy script task.
In the near future, *Java tasks might be removed*.

For instance, a script
task can be used to execute an inline script definition or a script file as an execution step whereas a
native task can be used to execute a native executable file.

One can use **ProActive Workflow Studio**  to create and submit workflows graphically .
You can simply drag-and-drop various task constructs and draw their dependencies to form complex jobs.
It also provides various flow control widgets such as conditional branch, loop, replicate etc to construct complex workflows.

image::flow_spec_dependency.png[align="center"]

In this tasks graph, we see that task 4 is preceded by task 1, that
means the Scheduler waits the end of task 1 execution before launching task
4. In a more concrete way, task 1 could be the calculation of a part of
the problem to solve, and task 4 takes the result provided by task 1 and
compute another step of the calculation. We introduce here the concept
of <<_passing_data_between_tasks,result passing>> between tasks. This relation is
called a <<_dependency>>, and we say that task 4 **depends** on task 1.

We see that task 1, 2 and 3 are not linked, so these three tasks can be
executed in **parallel**, because they are independent from each other.

The task graph is defined by the user at the time of workflow creation, but can also be modified during
 the job execution by control flow actions such as <<_replicate>>.

A *finished job* contains the results and logs of each task. Upon failure,
a task can be restarted automatically or cancelled.

=== A simple example

The link:http://try.activeeon.com/tutorials/quickstart/quickstart.html[quickstart tutorial, window="_blank"] on link:http://try.activeeon.com[try.activeeon.com, window="_blank"]
shows you how to build a simple workflow using script tasks.


We show below an example of a workflow created with the Studio:

image::GI_documentation_finance_url.png[align="center"]

At the left part, are illustrated the **General Parameters** of the workflow with the following information:

- `Name`: the name of the workflow.
- `Project`: the project name to which belongs the workflow.
- `Description`: the textual description of the workflow.
- `Documentation`: if the workflow has a Generic Information named "Documentation", then its URL value is displayed as a link. 
- `Job Priority`: the priority assigned to the workflow. It is by default set to `NORMAL`, but can be increased or decreased once the job is submitted. 





=== Docker task

In order for Docker tasks to work, the _Node_ must have Docker and Docker Compose installed, please refer to the official
 Docker documentation to see how to install http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Docker^] and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose^].

A Docker task expects the content of a Docker Compose file inside the _Script_ section. You can find out how to write Docker Compose files
with the official https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose documentation^].

To get started: a simple Docker Compose example is explained below.

The content of the _Script_ section (equal to the content of a Docker Compose file) is:
---
helloworld:
    image: busybox
    command: echo "Hello ProActive"
---
The above example describes a container which is called 'helloworld'. That container is created from a busybox image,
 which will run the command 'echo "Hello ProActive"'


=== Native application

Using native tasks you can easily reuse existing applications and embed them in a workflow.
The Scheduler lets you define a native task that takes the name of the executable and list of parameters.
Once the executable is wrapped as a task you can easily leverage some of the workflow constructs to run your
executable in parallel.

TIP:  We advise you to test your application first, make sure that it works with a simple use case on
one machine and then embed it in a workflow.

You can find an example of such integration in this
link:examples/native_task.xml[XML workflow^] or you can also build one yourself using the
*Workflow Studio*.

Native application by nature can be tied to a given operating system so
if you have different nodes at your disposal, you might need to select a suitable node to run your native task.
This can be achieved using <<_selection,selection script>>.

=== Scripting language support

Proactive Scheduler supports tasks  written in languages other than Java. The currently supported dynamic languages are
link:http://groovy.codehaus.org[Groovy, window="_blank"],
link:http://www.jython.org[Jython, window="_blank"],
link:https://www.python.org/[Python, window="_blank"],
link:http://jruby.org[Ruby, window="_blank"] and
link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/programmer_guide/#jsengine[Javascript, window="_blank"].

Native scripts can also be executed using a script task. Currently Bash and CMD scripts are supported,
simply set the language attribute to `bash` or `cmd` and type your script in the workflow.

You can easily embed small scripts in your workflow.
The nice thing is that the workflow will be self-contained and will not require to compile your code before executing. However, we
recommend that you keep these scripts small to keep the workflow easy to understand.

TIP: Use scripts to print debugging statements when you build a new workflow.

Please note that the script execution relies on Java implementation of the cited languages thus it may come with
some limitations.

You can find an example of a script task in this
link:examples/script_task.xml[XML workflow^] or you can also build one yourself using the
*Workflow Studio*. The link:http://try.activeeon.com/tutorials/quickstart/quickstart.html[quickstart tutorial, window="_blank"]
relies on script task and is a nice introduction to workflows.

Scripts can also be used to decorate tasks with specific actions, we support
<<_pre_post_clean,pre>>, <<_pre_post_clean,post>>, <<_pre_post_clean,clean>> and <<_selection,selection>> scripts.

==== Python Script Engine

Since there are many different versions of Python (mainly Python2 and Python3) which are not compatible, ProActive supports all the versions of python.
By default, the Python used to execute the Script is the default Python version on your machine. In order to use another Python version to execute
the task, it is required to put a key 'PYTHON_COMMAND' in Generic Info, and its value is the path (symbolic or absolute, for example 'python3' or
/usr/local/opt/python3/bin/python3.6) to the python executable that you want to use. Of course the required Python needs to be installed on your machine,
and the corresponding py4j module as well.

=== MPI application

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface[MPI^] is often used in the area of parallel computing.
The Scheduler integrates with MPI with the concept of <<_multi_node_task,multi node tasks>>.
 This particular task will acquire several nodes and will expose these nodes to the MPI environment.

Applications built with MPI are often executed using the http://linux.die.net/man/1/mpirun[mpirun^] command.
It accepts several parameters to
choose how many CPUs and how many machines will be used. One particular parameter is the machine file that is
built by the Scheduler when using *multi node tasks*.
Here is how an MPI application invocation would look like when executed with the Scheduler:

    mpirun -hostfile $variables_PA_NODESFILE myApplication

The <<_workflow_variables,variable>> `$variables_PA_NODESFILE` contains the path to a machine file created by the Scheduler that will be similar to:

    compute-host
    compute-host
    another-host

Meaning that `myApplication` will use 2 CPUs on `compute-host` and 1 CPU on `another-host`.
You can also use `$variables_PA_NODESNUMBER` to retrieve the number of acquired nodes.

You can find an example of a native task in this
link:examples/mpi_task.xml[XML workflow^] or you can also build one yourself using the
*Workflow Studio*.

To achieve the best performance for MPI applications, nodes can be selected taking into account their *network topology*. One might want to select nodes that are as
close to each other as possible to obtain better network performance or nodes on different hosts to split the I/O load.
Refer to <<_topology_types>> for more details.

=== Run a workflow

To run a workflow, the user submits it to *ProActive Scheduler*.
It will be possible to choose the values of all Job Variables when submitting the workflow (see section <<_job_variables,Job Variables>>).
A verification is performed to ensure the well-formedness of the workflow.
A verification will also be performed to ensure that all variables are valid according to their model definition (see section <<_variable_model,Variable Model>>).
Next, a job is created and inserted into the pending queue and
waits until free resources become available.
Once the required resources are provided by the ProActive Resource Manager, the job is started. Finally,
once the job is finished, it goes to the queue of finished
jobs where its result can be retrieved.

You can submit a workflow to the Scheduler using the *Workflow Studio*, the Scheduler Web Interface or <<_scheduler_command_line,command
line tools>>. For advanced users we also expose REST and JAVA APIs.

TIP: During the submission, you will be able to edit <<_workflow_variables>>, so you can effectively use
them to parameterize workflow execution and use workflows as <<_templating,templates>>.

==== Job & Task states

During their execution, jobs and tasks go through different states:

.Job States
[cols="17%,17%,66%", options="header"]
|===
| State | Name | Description
| `CANCELED` | Cancelled | The job has been canceled because of an exception.
This status is used when an exception is thrown by the user code of a task and when the user has asked to cancel the job on exception.
| `FAILED` | Failed | The job has failed. One or more tasks have failed (due to resources failure).
There is no more executionOnFailure left for a task.
| `FINISHED` | Finished | The job is finished. Tasks are finished or faulty.
| `IN_ERROR` | In-Error | The job has at least one In-Error task and all In-Error tasks are the last, among others, which have changed their state.
| `KILLED` | Killed | The job has been killed by the user.
| `PAUSED` | Paused | The job is paused waiting for user to resume it.
| `PENDING` | Pending | The job is waiting to be scheduled.
| `RUNNING` | Running | The job is running. At least one of its task has been scheduled.
| `STALLED` | Stalled | The job has been launched but no task is currently running.

|===


.Task States
[cols="17%,17%,66%", options="header"]
|===
| State | Name | Description |
 `ABORTED` | Aborted | The task has been aborted by an exception on an other task while the task is running. (job is cancelOnError=true).
 Can be also in this status if the job is killed while the concerned task was running. |
 `FAILED` | Resource down | The task is failed
(only if maximum number of execution has been reached and the node on which it was started is down).|
 `FAULTY` | Faulty | The task has finished execution with error code (!=0) or exception. |
 `FINISHED` | Finished | The task has finished execution. |
 `IN_ERROR` | In-Error | The task is suspended after first error, if the user has asked to suspend it. The task is waiting for a manual restart action. |
 `NOT_RESTARTED` | Could not restart | The task could not be restarted.
  It means that the task could not be restarted after an error
  during the previous execution. |
 `NOT_STARTED` | Could not start | The task could not be started.
  It means that the task could not be started due to
   dependencies failure.|
 `PAUSED` | Paused | The task is paused.|
 `PENDING` | Pending | The task is in the scheduler pending queue.|
 `RUNNING` | Running | The task is executing.|
 `SKIPPED` | Skipped | The task was not executed: it was the non-selected branch of an IF/ELSE control flow action. |
 `SUBMITTED` | Submitted | The task has just been submitted by the user.|
 `WAITING_ON_ERROR` | Faulty... | The task is waiting for restart after an error (i.e. native code != 0 or exception, and maximum number of execution is not reached).|
 `WAITING_ON_FAILURE` | Failed... | The task is waiting for restart after a failure (i.e. node down). |

|===

// TODO state diagram

==== Job Priority

A job is assigned a default priority of `NORMAL` but the user can increase or decrease the priority once the
job has been submitted. When they are scheduled, jobs with the highest priory are executed first.

The following values are available:

- `IDLE`
- `LOWEST`
- `LOW`
- `NORMAL`
- `HIGH` can only be set by an administrator
- `HIGHEST` can only be set by an administrator

=== Retrieve logs

It is possible to retrieve multiple logs from a job, these logs can either be:

- The standard _output/error logs_ associated with a job.
- The standard _output/error logs_ associated with a task.
- The scheduler _server logs_ associated with a job.
- The scheduler _server logs_ associated with a task.

Unless your account belongs to an administrator group, you can only see the logs of a job that you own.

==== Retrieve logs from the portal

- `Job standard output/error logs`: +
To view the standard output or error logs associated with a job, select a job from the job list and then on the _Output_ tab in the bottom right panel. +
To view logs of a currently running job, you need to click on the _Streaming_ checkbox, the logs panel will be updated as soon as new log lines will be printed by this job.  +
If the job is terminated, you can click on the _Fetch output_ button to view the final output of the job. +
Logs are limited to 1024 lines. Should your job logs be longer, you can select the _Full logs (download)_ option from the drop down list.

- `Task standard output/error logs`: +
To view the standard output or error logs associated with a task, select a job from the job list and a task from the task list. +
Then in the _Output_ tab, choose _Selected task_ from the drop down list. +
Once the task is terminated, you will be able to click on the _Fetch output_ button to see the standard output or error associated with the task. +
It is not possible to view the streaming logs of single task, only the job streaming logs are available.

- `Job server logs`: +
Whether a job is running or finished, you can access the associated server logs by selecting a job, opening the _Server Logs_ tab in the bottom-right panel and then clicking on _Fetch logs_. +
Server logs contains debugging information, such as the job definition, output of selection or cleaning scripts, etc.

- `Task server logs`: +
In the _Server Logs_ tab, you can choose _Selected task_ to view the server logs associated with a single task.

==== Retrieve logs from the command line

The chapter <<_scheduler_command_line,command line tools>> explains how to use the command line interface.
Once connected, you can retrieve the various logs using the following commands. Server logs cannot be accessed from the command line.

- `Job standard output/error logs`: joboutput(jobid) +
----
> joboutput(1955)
[1955t0@precision;14:10:57] [2016-10-27 14:10:057 precision] HelloWorld

> livelog(2002)
Displaying live log for job 2002. Press 'q' to stop.
> Displaying live log for job 2002. Press 'q' to stop.
[2002t2@precision;15:57:13] [ABC, DEF]
----

=== Retrieve results

Once a job or a task is terminated, it is possible to get its result. Unless you belong to the administrator group, you can only get the result of the job that you own.
Results can be retrieved using the Scheduler Web Interface or the command line tools.

NOTE: When running native application, the task result will be the exit code of the application. Results
usually make more sense when using script or Java tasks.

==== Retrieve results from the portal

In the scheduler portal, select a job, then select a task from the job's task list. Click on _Preview_ tab in the bottom-right panel.

In this tab, you will see two buttons:

- `Open in browser`: when clicking on this button, the result will be displayed in a new browser tab. By default, the result will be displayed in text format.
If your result contains binary data, it is possible to specify a different display mode using <<_result_metadata>>. +
If the task failed, when clicking on the _Open in browser_ button, the task error will be displayed.

- `Save as file`: when clicking on this button, the result will be saved on disk in binary format. By default, the file name will be generated automatically using the job and task ids, without an extension.
It is possible to customize this behavior and specify in the task a file name, or a file extension using <<_result_metadata>>.

The following example gets one png image and add the metadata to help the browser display it and add a name when downloading.
----
file = new File(fileName)
result = file.getBytes()
resultMetadata.put("file.name", fileName)
resultMetadata.put("content.type", "image/png")
----

==== Retrieve results from the command line

The chapter <<_scheduler_command_line,command line tools>> explains how to use the command line interface.
Once connected, you can retrieve the task or job results:

- `Result of a single task`: taskresult(jobid, taskname)
----
> taskresult(2002, 'Merge')
task('Merge') result: true
----

- `Result of all tasks of a job`: jobresult(jobid)
----
> jobresult(2002)
job('2002') result:
Merge : true
Process*1 : DEF
Process : ABC
Split : {0=abc, 1=def}
----

== Data Management

One of the major questions after having learned to submit and execute simple tasks is how to handle data.

ProActive Scheduler provides two mechanisms for accessing and propagating data down the execution chain. One is based on <<_variable_based_propagation,variables>> and the other on <<_file_based_propagation,files>>.

=== Variable based propagation

Variables used for data access and propagation exist in three flavors:

- <<_workflow_variables,Workflow variables>>
- <<_generic_information>>
- <<_passing_data_between_tasks_using_results,Result variables>>

Their usage depends of the context (see <<_variables_quick_reference>>).

==== Workflow variables

===== Job variables

In a workflow you can define *job variables* that can be used in all tasks.

A job variable is defined using the following attributes:

* *name*: the name of the variable
* *value*: the value of the variable
* *model*: the type of the value (optional). See section <<_variable_model,Variable Model>>


[[_templating]]
Variables are very useful to use workflows as templates where only a few parameters change for each
execution. Upon submission you can define variable values either from <<_scheduler_command_line, CLI>> or from
the Web interfaces.

The following example shows how to define a job variable:
[source, xml]
----
<job ... >
    <variables>
        <variable name="variable" value="value" model=""/>
    </variables>
    ...
</job>
----

*Job variables* can be referenced anywhere in the workflow, including other job variables.

The syntax for referencing a variable is the pattern `${variable_name}` (case-sensitive), for example:

[source, xml]
----
<nativeExecutable>
    <staticCommand value="${variable}" />
</nativeExecutable>
----

===== Task variables

Similarly to job variables, *Task variables* can be defined inside a task. Task variables scope is strictly limited to the task definition.

A task variable is defined using the following attributes:

* *name*: the name of the variable
* *value*: the value of the variable
* *inherited*: asserts whether the propagated value should be use instead of the *value* value. If _true_, the *value* field can be empty. As a consequence, inheritance requires to declare the variable value at Workflow level
* *model*: the type of the value (optional). See section <<_variable_model,Variable Model>>

For example:
[source, xml]
----
<task ... >
    <variables>
        <variable name="variable" value="value" inherited="false" model=""/>
    </variables>
    ...
</task>
----
Task variables can be used similarly to job variables using the pattern `${variable_name}` but only inside the task where the variable is defined.

Task variables override job variables, this means that if a job variable and a task variable are defined with the same name, the task variable value will be used inside the task, and the job variable value will be used elsewhere in the job.

===== Variable Model

Job and Task variables can define a `model` attribute which let the workflow designer control the variable value syntax.
A workflow designer can for example decide that the variable NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES is expected to be convertible to an Integer ranged between 0 and 20.

The workflow designer will then provide a default value to the variable NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES, for example "10". This workflow is valid as "10" can be converted to an Integer and is between 0 and 20.

When submitting the workflow, it will be possible to choose a new value for the variable NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES.
If the user submitting the workflow chooses for example the value -5, the validation will fail and an error message will appear.

====== Available Models

The following list describes the various model syntaxes available:

* *PA:BOOLEAN* : variable is either "true", "false", "0" or "1".
* *PA:INTEGER* , *PA:INTEGER[min,max]* : variable can be converted to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/lang/Integer.html[java.lang.Integer], and eventually is contained in the range [min, max]. +
Examples : PA:INTEGER will accept "-5" but not "1.4", PA:INTEGER[0,20] will accept "12" but not "25".
* *PA:LONG* , *PA:LONG[min,max]* : same as above with https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/lang/Long.html[java.lang.Long].
* *PA:FLOAT* , *PA:FLOAT[min,max]* : same as above with https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/lang/Float.html[java.lang.Float]. +
Examples: PA:FLOAT[-0.33,5.99] will accept "3.5" but not "6".
* *PA:DOUBLE* , *PA:DOUBLE[min,max]* : same as above with https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/lang/Double.html[java.lang.Double].
* *PA:SHORT* , *PA:SHORT[min,max]* : same as above with https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/lang/Short.html[java.lang.Short].
* *PA:URL* : variable can be converted to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/net/URL.html[java.net.URL]. +
Examples: PA:URL will accept "http://mysite.com" but not "c:/Temp".
* *PA:URI* : variable can be converted to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/net/URI.html[java.net.URI]. +
Examples: PA:URI will accept "/tmp/file" but not "c:\a^~to" due to invalid characters.
* *PA:DATETIME(format)* , *PA:DATETIME(format)[min,max]* : variable can be converted to a https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/util/Date.html[java.util.Date] using the format specified (see the format definition syntax in the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html[SimpleDateFormat] class). +
A range can also be used in the PA:DATETIME model. In that case, each bound of the range must match the date format used. +
+
Examples: +
PA:DATETIME(yyyy-MM-dd) will accept "2014-12-01" but not "2014". +
PA:DATETIME(yyyy-MM-dd)[2014-01-01, 2015-01-01] will accept "2014-12-01" but not "2015-03-01". +
PA:DATETIME(yyyy-MM-dd)[2014, 2015] will result in an error during the workflow definition as the range bounds [2014, 2015] are not using the format yyyy-MM-dd.
* *PA:LIST(item1,item2,...)* : variable must be one of the values defined in the list. +
Examples: PA:LIST(a,b,c) will accept "a", "b", "c" but no other value.
* *PA:REGEXP(pattern)* : variable syntax must match the regular expression defined in the pattern. The regular expression syntax is described in class https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Pattern]. +
Examples: PA:REGEXP([a-z]+) will accept "abc", "foo", but not "Foo".
* *PA:MODEL_FROM_URL(url)* : variable syntax must match the model fetched from the given url. This can be used for example when the model needs to represent a list of elements which may evolve over time and is updated inside a file. Such as a list of machines in an infrastructure, a list of users, etc. +
Examples: PA:MODEL_FROM_URL(file:///srv/machines_list_model.txt), if the file machines_list_model.txt contains PA:LIST(host1,host2), will accept only "host1" and "host2", but may accept other values as the machines_list_model file changes.
* *PA:CRON* : variable syntax must be a valid cron expression as defined in the  http://www.sauronsoftware.it/projects/cron4j/manual.php#p02[cron4j manual]. +
Examples: PA:CRON will accept "5 * * * \*" but not "* * * *" (missing minutes sub-pattern).
* *PA:SPEL(SpEL expression)* : variable syntax will be evaluated by a https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html[SpEL] expression. Refer to next paragraph.

====== Spring Expression Language Model

The PA:SPEL(expr) model allows to define expressions able to validate a variable value or not. Additionally, this model can be used to validate multiple variable values or to dynamically update other variables.
The syntax of the SpEL expression is defined by the https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html[Spring Expression Language reference].

In order to interact with variables, the expression has access to the following properties:

* *#value* : this property will contain the value of the current variable defined by the user.
* *variables['variable_name']* : this property array contains all the variables of the same context (for example of the same task for a task variable).

The SpEL expression must return a *boolean value*, `true` if the value is correct, `false` otherwise, returning another type will raise an error.

* *Example of SpEL simple validations:* +
+
PA:SPEL(#value == 'abc') : will accept the value if it's the 'abc' string +
PA:SPEL(T(Integer).parseInt(#value) > 10) : will accept the value if it's an integer greater than 10. +
+
Note that #value always contains a string and must be converted to other types if needed. +
+
* *Example of SpEL multiple validations:* +
+
PA:SPEL(variables['var1'] + variables['var2'] == 'abcdef') : will be accepted if the string concatenation of variable var1 and var2 is 'abcdef'. +
PA:SPEL(T(Integer).parseInt(variables['var1']) + T(Integer).parseInt(variables['var2']) < 100) : will be accepted if the sum of variables var1 and var2 are smaller than 100. +
+
* *Example of SpEL variable inference:* +
+
PA:SPEL( variables['var2'] == '' ? (variables['var2'] = variables['var1']) instanceof T(String) : true ) : if the variable var2 is empty, it will use the value of variable var1 instead. +
+
Note that the SpEL expression must always return a boolean value, this is why in this last expression we use the instanceof keyword to avoid returning a string value.


===== ProActive system variables

Some variables are explicitly defined by the Scheduler to retrieve runtime information about a job or a task.

Here is the list of ProActive system variables:

.ProActive variables
[cols="2,5,2"]
|===
| *Variable name* | *Description* | *Type*

|===

They can be used inside the workflow with the pattern syntax, for example:

[source, xml]
----
<task ...>
    ...
     <forkEnvironment workingDir="/opt/${PA_JOB_ID}"></forkEnvironment>
    ...
</task>
----

===== Dynamic replacements

It is possible to combine recursive definitions of variables.

For example, one could write:
----
<task ...>
    ...
     <forkEnvironment workingDir="/opt/${DIRECTORY_${PA_TASK_REPLICATION}}"></forkEnvironment>
    ...
</task>
----

In that case, the variable `DIRECTORY_0` or `DIRECTORY_1`, etc (depending on the replication index) will be used in the working dir attribute.

Pattern variable replacements may be performed at submission time or at execution time:

- A replacement performed at *execution time* means that the replacement is executed only when the task enclosing the replacement is executed.
- A replacement performed at *submission time* means that the replacement is directly executed when the job is submitted to the scheduler.

Replacements directly using global job or task variables will always be performed at submission time.

In the following example, the description replacement is performed at submission time:

[source, xml]
----
<job ... >
    <variables>
        <variable name="description" value="My ProActive workflow"/>
    </variables>
    ...
    <task ... >
        <description>${description}</description>

    </task>
</job>
----

Replacements using system variables, such as the workingDir example above, will always be performed at execution time.


===== Variables map and propagation

In addition to the ability to use variables directly inside the workflow with the pattern syntax, it is also possible to use
all type of variables inside scripts thanks to the `variables` map.

Inside a script, `variables` is bound to a http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html[Map^].
The syntax to access it might differ given the script engine you are using.

For example in a *Groovy* script task, you can use:

[source, groovy]
----
String var = variables.get("one_variable")
variables.put("other_variable", "foo")
----

The first line access the variable `one_variable` from the `variables` map.
The second line stores in the variables map a new variable called `other_variable`.

System variables can also be accessed from the `variables` map, for example:

[source, groovy]
----
println variables.get("PA_JOB_ID") // will display the id of the current job
----

From a native executable, for instance a Shell script, variables are accessible through environment variables.

[source, bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
echo $variables_PA_TASK_NAME
----

WARNING: In native tasks and Bash/CMD script engines, variables can be read but not written to.

The `variables` map is propagated down the execution chain. If a task modifies a variable in the variables map, or add a new variable, all dependent tasks will have access to this modification.

For example:

[source, groovy]
----
// task1
String var = variables.get("one_variable")
variables.put("one_variable", "foo")
variables.put("other_variable", "bar")
----

[source, groovy]
----
// task2 depends on task1
println variables.get("one_variable") // will display "foo"
println variables.get("other_variable") // will display "bar"
----

If a task depends on several tasks and each task modifies the same variable, the final value of the variable
which is propagated down the execution chain, depends on the *order of task execution*.
Therefore, the users need to take appropriate measures to prevent any undesired effects of such race conditions.

You can set any link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html[Java serializable object, window="_blank"]
 as a variable value. They will be converted into strings using
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#toString()[toString()^]
 method when required, for instance, to make those values available as environment variables in native tasks.

==== Generic Information

In addition to variables, another key/value structure can be accessed inside a script: *_Generic Information_*.

Generic information semantics differ from <<_workflow_variables>> semantics in the following way:

 * Generic information can be accessed inside a script, but cannot be modified.
 * Generic information can be defined at *job level* or at *task level*. If the same generic information is defined at job level and at task level, the latter value takes precedence inside the task scope.
 * Generic information cannot be used directly inside the workflow with the syntax ${} (See  <<_workflow_variables>>).
 * Generic information are used in general internally by the scheduler, for example to provide information to the scheduling loop on how to handle the task. An example of such generic information is the _START_AT_ info used inside <<_cron_tasks>>.
 * Generic information can use in their definition job/task variables patterns, pattern replacements can be done at execution time when using task generic information.

Example of generic information definition:

For example:
[source, xml]
----
<task ... >
    <genericInformation>
        <info name="ginfo" value="${test}"/>
    </genericInformation>
    ...
</task>
----

==== Passing data between tasks using results

Another important mechanism of data exchange is the task *result* variable. Anywhere in a task (usually at the end) you can set a value to a reserved
variable named *result* using any Java object. This value will be available in tasks depending on it. Moreover, in case of several dependencies,
results will be aggregated into a new array variable named *results*.

Assuming that we have two tasks *task1* and *task2* written in Groovy:

[source, groovy]
----
// task1
result = "task1";
----

[source, groovy]
----
// task2
result = "task2";
----

and *task3* that depends on tasks *task1* and *task2*, then, you can access result values defined by the parents as follows:

[source, groovy]
----
// task3
println(results[0]);
// will print "task1"
println(results[1]);
// will print "task2"
----

NOTE: results will be aggregated according to the order declared in the dependency list. Consequently, if the xml *depends* tag of *task3* contains the list [task1, task2] (see the xml example below), then results[0] will contain the result of *task1* and results[1] the result of *task2*. On the contrary, if the depends list is [task2, task1], then results[0] will contain the result of *task2* and results[1] the result of *task1*.

[source, xml]
----
<depends>
        <task ref="task1"/>
        <task ref="task2"/>
</depends>
----

For nearly all script languages, the *results* variable contains a list of http://doc.activeeon.com/javadoc/latest/org/ow2/proactive/scheduler/common/task/TaskResult.html[TaskResult java object].
In order to access the result value, the value() method of this object must be called.
Example for Python:
[source, python]
----
print results[0].value()
----

==== Result metadata

Result metadata can contain additional information associated with the result. In order to store metadata information, use the following syntax, if task2 depends on task1:

[source, groovy]
----
// task1
result = "task1";
resultMetadata.put("mymetadata", "myvalue")
----

[source, groovy]
----
// task2
println(results[0].getMetadata());
----

It is up to the user code to decide the metadata semantics, but some specific metadata can have a meaning when downloading or previewing results from the *Scheduler portal*:

- *file.name* : the name of the file, including the extension, which will be used when storing the result in binary format.
+
[source, groovy]
----
// fileNameTask
file = new File("balloon13.png")
result = file.getBytes()
resultMetadata.put("file.name","balloon13.png")
----

- *file.extension* : the extension, which will be appended to the automatically generated name, when storing the result in binary format
+
[source, groovy]
----
// fileExtensionTask
file = new File("balloon13.png")
result = file.getBytes()
resultMetadata.put("file.extension",".png")
----

- *content.type* : the display format, which will be used when previewing the file in the browser. Open the following https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml[link] for the complete list of mime-types.
+
[source, groovy]
----
// contentTypeTask
file = new File("balloon13.png")
result = file.getBytes()
resultMetadata.put("content.type","image/png")
----

=== File based propagation

==== Input/Output Data in Shared Directory

The easiest way to use your data on computing machines is to set up a *shared directory* available on all Compute Hosts. For
Linux it's typically an NFS directory, for Windows it could be an SMB network share. Then, in tasks you can manipulate
files seamlessly across ProActive Nodes.

[source, java]
----
File inputData = new File("/data/username/inputfile");
----

This approach has some limitations though:

* The path to the shared folder should be *identical* on all Compute Hosts
* It can be difficult to use with *heterogeneous resources*, e.g. Linux and Windows hosts

==== Data Spaces

===== Global and User Spaces

If a shared folder is not an option in your environment, the ProActive Scheduler provides a convenient way to access
your data. It has two types of storage on the host where the server is running:

* A *Global Space* where anyone can read/write files
* An *User Space* which is a personal user data storage

By default, these spaces are linked to folders in the *data* directory of the ProActive Scheduler host:

 * `PROACTIVE_HOME/data/defaultglobal`
 * `PROACTIVE_HOME/data/defaultuser`

But it can be changed in `PROACTIVE_HOME/config/scheduler/settings.ini`.

===== Local Space

All files that are stored in these spaces can be read from all computing nodes. However, data transfer is declarative and not explicit.
You need to define which files have to be transferred from a data space to computing nodes by using *input files* and reciprocally from computing nodes to a data space by defining *output files*:

[source, xml]
----
<task name="task1">
    ...
    <inputFiles>
        <files includes="tata" accessMode="transferFromGlobalSpace"/>
    </inputFiles>
    <outputFiles>
        <files includes="titi*" accessMode="transferToGlobalSpace"/>
    </outputFiles>
    ...
</task>
----

Upon the execution of the previous example, Proactive Scheduler automatically transfers all files to a ProActive Node where the task will be executed. The files are put in a special place called *Local Space* on the ProActive Node. It corresponds to the working directory of a task when the task is in fork mode (default).
From a task point of view, files can be accessed normally like shown below:

[source, java]
----
File inputFile = new File("tata")
----

Then, based on the previous task definition, all the files whose the name starts with _titi_ (e.g titi, titi2, etc.) produced by _task1_ will be transferred back automatically to Global Space by the Scheduler once the task is finished.

Files can be also transferred from/to User Space by specifying `transferFromUserSpace`/`transferToUserSpace`.

Before running your jobs you should first *upload* your files into either Global or User Space. To do it you can export folders linked to
these spaces by one of the standard protocols like *FTP*, *NFS*, or use available web interfaces like
http://pyd.io[Pydio^].

It is possible to use wildcards in transfer directives, such as:

[source, xml]
----
<task name="task1">
    ...
    <inputFiles>
        <files includes="**/tata" accessMode="transferFromGlobalSpace"/>
    </inputFiles>
    <outputFiles>
        <files includes="*" accessMode="transferToGlobalSpace"/>
    </outputFiles>
    ...
</task>
----

More information of pattern syntax can be found in the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher(java.lang.String)[FileSystem class JDK documentation].


===== Cache Space

In addition to transferring to the Task *Local Space*, it is also possible to transfer files to the Node host *Cache Space*.

From the Node host point of view, the Cache Space is *unique* and shared for all tasks and all ProActive Nodes deployed on the host.

Transfers to the cache are *not concurrent*, only a single task can transfer to the cache at the same time. I.e if multiple tasks are run in parallel on the same hosts and they all transfer to the cache, these transfers will be executed sequentially.

If a file declared for the transfer is newer than the existing version in the cache, the file will be updated.

In order to transfer files to the cache, simply use the cache transfer directives inside your job:

[source, xml]
----
<task name="task1">
    ...
    <inputFiles>
        <files includes="tata" accessMode="cacheFromGlobalSpace"/>
        <files includes="toto" accessMode="cacheFromUserSpace"/>
    </inputFiles>
    ...
</task>
----

The files will not be transferred to the Local Space of the task, so it will not be possible to access these files from the current directory.

In order to access these files, use the *cachespace* variable which contains the location of the cache, for example in groovy:

[source, groovy]
----
inputFile = new File(cachespace, "tata")
----

There are no transfer directives to transfer output files *from* the cache. Output files transfers are only possible from the *Local Space*.

Files in the cache space are *automatically deleted* after a given period. The default invalidation period is two weeks, which means that files older than two weeks will be automatically deleted.

In order to change this period, the ProActive Node must be started with the property *node.dataspace.cache.invalidation.period* (in miliseconds).

The property *node.dataspace.cachedir* can also be used to control the cache location on the node.


== Workflow concepts

Workflows comes with constructs that help you distribute your computation. The tutorial
http://try.activeeon.com/tutorials/adv.html[Advanced workflows^] is a nice introduction to workflows with
ProActive.

The following constructs are available:

- *Dependency*
- *Replicate*
- *Branch*
- *Loop*

TIP: Use the *Workflow Studio* to create complex workflows, it is much easier than writing XML!

=== Dependency

Dependencies can be set between tasks in a TaskFlow job. It provides a way to execute your tasks in a specified order,
but also to forward result of an ancestor task to its children as parameter. Dependency between tasks is then
both a temporal dependency and a data dependency.

image::flow_spec_dependency.png[align="center"]

Dependencies between tasks can be added either in *ProActive Workflow Studio* or simply in workflow XML as shown below:

[source, xml]
----
<taskFlow>
    <task name="task1">
        <scriptExecutable>
            <script>
                <code language="groovy">
                    println "Executed first"
                </code>
            </script>
        </scriptExecutable>
    </task>
    <task name="task2">
        <depends>
            <task ref="task1"/>
        </depends>
        <scriptExecutable>
            <script>
                <code language="groovy">
                    println "Now it's my turn"
                </code>
            </script>
        </scriptExecutable>
    </task>
</taskFlow>
----

[[_replicate]]
=== Replicate

The *replication* allows the execution of multiple tasks in parallel when only one task
is defined and the number of tasks to run could change.

image::flow_spec_duplicate.png[align=center]

-   The target is the direct child of the task initiator.

-   The initiator can have multiple children; each child is replicated.

-   If the target is a *start block*, the whole block is replicated.

-   The target must have the initiator as only dependency: the action is
    performed when the initiator task terminates. If the target has an
    other pending task as dependency, the behaviour cannot be specified.

-   There should always be a merge task after the target of a replicate:
    if the target is not a start block, it should have at least one
    child, if the target is a start block, the corresponding end block
    should have at least one child.

-   The last task of a replicated task block (or the replicated task if
    there is no block) cannot perform a *branching* or *replicate*
    action.

-   The target of a *replicate* action can not be tagged as *end block*.

- The current replication index (from to 0 to `runs`) can be accessed via the
`PA_TASK_REPLICATION` <<_workflow_variables,variable>>.

TIP: If you are familiar with programming, you can see the replication as forking tasks.

=== Branch

The *branch* construct provides the ability to choose between two alternative task flows,
with the possibility to merge back to a common flow.

image::flow_spec_if.png[align=center]

-   There is no explicit dependency between the initiator and the
    *if/else* targets. These are *optional links* (ie. A -> B or E ->
    F) defined in the *if* task.

-   The *if* and *else* flows can be merged by a *continuation* task
    referenced in the *if* task, playing the role of an *endif*
    construct. After the branching task, the flow will either be that of
    the *if* or the *else* task, but it will be continued by the
    *continuation* task.

-   *If* and *else* targets are executed *exclusively*. The initiator
    however can be the dependency of other tasks, which will be executed
    normally along the *if* or the *else* target.

-   A *task block* can be defined across *if*, *else* and *continuation*
    links, and not just plain dependencies (i.e. with *A* as *start* and
    *F* as *end*).

-   If using no continuation task, the if and else targets, along with
    their children, must be strictly distinct.

-   If using a continuation task, the if and else targets must be
    strictly distinct and valid task blocks.

-   *if*, *else* and *continuation* tasks (B, D and F) cannot have
    an explicit dependency.

-   *if*, *else* and *continuation* tasks cannot be entry points for the
    job, they must be triggered by the *if* control flow action.

-   A task can be target of only one *if* or *else* action. A
    *continuation* task can not merge two different *if* actions.

TIP: If you are familiar with programming, you can see the branch as a if/then/else.

=== Loop

The loop provides the ability to repeat a set of tasks.

image::flow_spec_loop.png[align=center]

-   The target of a *loop* action must be a parent of the initiator
    following the dependency chain; this action goes back to a
    previously executed task.

-   Every task is executed at least once; *loop* operates in a
    *do...while* fashion.

-   The target of a *loop* should have only one explicit dependency. It
    will have different parameters (dependencies) depending if it is
    executed for the first time or not. The cardinality should stay the
    same.

-   The *loop* scope should be a *task block*: the target is a *start
    block* task, and the initiator its related *end block task*.

- The current iteration index (from 0 to n until `loop` is false) can be accessed via the
    `PA_TASK_ITERATION` <<_workflow_variables,variable>>.

TIP: If you are familiar with programming, you can see the loop as a do/while.

=== Task Blocks

Workflows often relies on *task blocks*. Task blocks are defined by pairs of *start* and *end* tags.

-   Each task of the flow can be tagged either *start* or *end*

-   Tags can be nested

-   Each *start* tag needs to match a distinct *end* tag

Task blocks are very similar to the parenthesis of most programming
languages: anonymous and nested start/end tags. The only difference is
that a parenthesis is a syntactical information, whereas task blocks are
semantic.

The role of task blocks is to restrain the expressiveness of the system
so that a workflow can be statically checked and validated. A treatment
that can be looped or iterated will be isolated in a well-defined task
block.

-   A *loop* flow action only applies on a task block: the initiator of
 the loop must be the end of the block, and the target must be the
 beginning.

-   When using a *continuation* task in an *if* flow action, the *if*
 and *else* branches must be task blocks.

-   If the child of a *replicate* task is a task block, the whole block
 will be replicated and not only the child of the initiator.

=== Control Flow Scripts

To perform a control flow action such as if, replicate or loop, a
*Control Flow Script* is executed on the ProActive node. This script
takes the result of the task as input; meaning a Java object if it was a
Java or Script task, or nothing if it was a native task.

The script is executed on the ProActive node, just after the task's
executable. If the executable is a Java Executable and returns a result,
the variable `result` will be set in the script's environment so that
dynamic decisions can be taken with the task's result as input. Native
Java objects can be used in a Groovy script.

.Decide whether to keep looping or not based on the task's result:
[source,groovy]
----
loop = result
----

Similarly to how parameters are passed through the *result* variable to
the script, the script needs to define variables specific to each action
to determine what action the script will lead to.

-   A *replicate* control flow action needs to define how many parallel
    runs will be executed, by defining the variable `runs`:

[source,groovy]
----
// assuming result is a java.lang.Integer
runs = result % 4 + 1
----

The assigned value needs be a strictly positive integer.

-   An *if* control flow action needs to determine whether the if or the
    else branch is selected, it does this by defining the boolean
    variable `branch`:

[source,groovy]
----
// assuming result is a java.lang.Integer
if (result % 2) {
  branch = "if"
} else {
  branch = "else"
}
----

The assigned value needs to be the string value _if_ or _else_.

-   The *loop* control flow action requires setting the `loop`, which
    will determine whether looping to the statically defined target is
    performed, or if the normal flow is executed as would a continue
    instruction do in a programming language:

[source,groovy]
----
loop = result as Boolean
----

The assigned value needs to be a boolean.

Failure to set the required variables or to provide a valid
control flow script will not be treated gracefully and will result in
the failure of the task.

=== Loop and Replicate awareness

When Control Flow actions such as *replicate* or *loop* are performed,
some tasks are replicated. To be able to identify replicated tasks
uniquely, each replicated task has an *iteration index*, *replication
index*, and a *tag*. In addition to help to identify uniquely, these tags are
useful to filter tasks by iterations for example.


==== Task name

First, those indexes are reflected inside the names of the tasks
themselves. Indeed, task names must be unique inside a job. The indexes
are added to the original task name as a suffix, separated by a special
character.

-   If a task named _T_ is replicated after a *loop* action, the newly
    created tasks will be named _T#1_, _T#2_, etc. The number
    following the _#_ separator character represents the *iteration
    index*.

-   The same scheme is used upon *replicate* actions: newly created
    tasks are named _T*1_, _T*2_, and so on. The number following the
    $$*$$ separator represents the *replication index*.|

-   When combining both of the above, the resulting task names are of
    the form: _T#1*1_, _T#2*4_, etc., in that precise order.


==== Task tag

Tags are assigned automatically by the scheduler when a task is created by
replication from another task. They are designed to reflect the task that
initiated the replication for the first time, the type of replication (loop
or replicate) and the iteration index or replication indexes. So the tag is
formed like this: *(LOOP|REPLICATE)-Name_of_the_initiator-index*.

-   If the task _T1_ initiates a loop that contains the tasks _T2_ and _T3_,
    then the tasks _T2#1_ and _T3#1_ will have the tag *LOOP-T1-1*. The tasks
    _T2#2_ and _T3#2_ will have the tag *LOOP-T1-3*.

-   If the loop is a cron loop, the index is replaced by the resolved time of
    the initiated looping. For example, in a cron loop that was initiated the
    21/12/2015 at 14h00, the task _T1#1_ will have the tag *LOOP-T1#1-21_12_15_14_00*.

-   If the task _T1_ replicates a block that contains the tasks _T2_ and _T3_,
    then the tasks _T2*1_ and _T3*1_ will have the tag *REPLICATE-T1-1*. The
    tasks _T2*2_ and _T3*2_ will have the tag *REPLICATE-T1-2*.

-   If the task _T1#1_, inside a loop, replicates tasks, the new tasks will have
    the tags *REPLICATE-T1#1-1*, *REPLICATE-T1#1-2*, etc...

-   If the replicated task _T1*1_ initiates a loop inside a replicate, the new
    created tasks will have the tags *LOOP-T1*1-1*, *LOOP-T1*1-2*, etc...


==== Task definition

Those indexes are also available as <<_workflow_variables,workflow variables>>. They can be
obtained using the variable names:

* PA_TASK_REPLICATION
* PA_TASK_ITERATION

Here is how to access those variables:

-   *Native Executable arguments:*

``` {.xml}
<staticCommand value="/path/to/bin.sh">
  <arguments>
    <argument value="/some/path/${PA_TASK_ITERATION}/${PA_TASK_REPLICATION}.dat" />
```

-   *Dataspace input and output:*

``` {.xml}
<task name="t1" retries="2">
  <inputFiles>
    <files includes="foo_${PA_TASK_ITERATION}_${PA_TASK_REPLICATION}.dat" accessMode="transferFromInputSpace"/>
  </inputFiles><outputFiles>
    <files includes="bar_${PA_TASK_ITERATION}_${PA_TASK_REPLICATION}.res" accessMode="transferToOutputSpace"/>
```

NOTE: Scripts affected by the variable substitutions are: Pre, Post, Control Flow.
*No substitution will occur in selection scripts or clean scripts.*



==== Task executable

The iteration and replication indexes are available inside the
executables launched by tasks.

In script tasks, the indexes are exported through the following <<_workflow_variables,workflow variables>>:
 `PA_TASK_ITERATION` and `PA_TASK_REPLICATION`.

[source,groovy]
----
int it  = variables.get("PA_TASK_ITERATION")
int rep = variables.get("PA_TASK_REPLICATION")
----

In a similar fashion, environment variables are set when launching a
native executable: `PAS_TASK_ITERATION` and `PAS_TASK_REPLICATION`:

``` {.sh}
#!/bin/sh
myApp.sh /path/to/file/${variables_PAS_TASK_ITERATION}.dat

```

=== Example: Embarrassingly Parallel problem

An http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel[Embarrassingly Parallel problem^] is a problem that is easy
to split into smaller independent tasks. With ProActive Scheduler you can tackle this type of problem with the
<<_replicate>> construct.

TIP: Familiar with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce[MapReduce^]? Well, a workflow using replication
uses similar concepts.

The http://try.activeeon.com/tutorials/adv.html[Advanced workflows^] is an example of an embarrassingly parallel
problem where the computation is easily distributed across ProActive Nodes.

== Workflow Execution Control

*ProActive Scheduler* supports portable script execution through the *JSR-223* Java
Scripting capabilities. Scripts can be written in any language supported by the underlying
Java Runtime Environment.

They are used in the ProActive Scheduler to:

* Execute some simple *pre*, *post* and *cleaning* processing (pre scripts, post scripts and cleaning scripts)
* Select among available resources the node that *suits the execution* (selection scripts).

[[_selection]]
=== Selection of ProActive Nodes

A selection script provides an ability for the Scheduler to execute tasks on particular ProActive nodes.
E.g. you can specify that a task must be executed on a Unix/Linux system.

A selection script is always executed before the task itself on any candidate node:
the execution of a selection script must set the boolean variable selected,
that indicates if the candidate node is suitable for the execution of the associated task.

A Java helper *org.ow2.proactive.scripting.helper.selection.SelectionUtils* is provided for allowing
user to simply make some kind of selections. Some script samples are available in
`PROACTIVE_HOME/samples/scripts/selection`.

The following example selects only nodes running on Windows:

[source, javascript]
----
importClass(org.ow2.proactive.scripting.helper.selection.SelectionUtils);

/* Check if OS name is Windows */
if (SelectionUtils.checkOSName("windows")) {
    selected = true;
} else {
    selected = false;
}
----

[[_pre_post_clean]]
=== Pre, Post & Clean Scripts

Another functionality is the possibility to define pre and post scripts. For a given task (Java, Script or Native task),
it is possible to launch a script before and after its execution. This possibility can be useful to copy files
to a node, or clean a directory before or after task execution, for example.

This is a way to separate from business code the preparation of execution environment and its cleaning. A good example
is a script that removes files from a specific directory once the task is finished.

.Clean script example
[source, groovy]
----
Files.deleteIfExists(new File("/tmp/working_dir/").toPath())
----

=== Run computation with your system account

It is possible to start a task under the job owner if the system is configured for that purpose.
There are 2 possible ways to run a task under user account
(in any case, the administrator should have
link:../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.html#_run_as_me[set computing hosts] to authorize
one of the 2 methods) :

* Using your *scheduling login and password* : if computing hosts are configured and user is authorized to run a process under his login and password.
* Using an *SSH key* provided by the administrator : if computing hosts are configured, the administrator should have given user an SSH key.

User must first create a credential containing this key :

----
$ PROACTIVE_HOME/tools/proactive-create-cred -F config/authentication/keys/pub.key -l username -p userpwd -k path/to/private/sshkey -o myCredentials.cred
----

This command will create a new credentials with *username* as login, *userpwd* as password, using Scheduler public key at
`config/authentication/keys/pub.key`
for credentials encryption and using the private SSH key at
`path/to/private/sshkey`
provided by administrator. The new credential will be stored in *myCredentials.cred*

Once created, user must connect the Scheduler using this credential. Then, in order to execute your task under your account
set *runAsMe=true* in the task.

TIP: You can now use <<_third_party_credentials,third party credentials>> to store the SSH key with the special entry named *SSH_PRIVATE_KEY*.

[[_multi_node_task]]
=== Reserve more than one node for a task

To create a <<_mpi_application,multi-nodes>> task often used for MPI applications you need to add a *parallel environment*
to the task. Parallel environment describes how many nodes are needed for a task as well as where these nodes should be
located. For example if you'd like to run 4 processes in parallel it a scope of one task you should specify it in your task

[source, xml]
----
<parallel numberOfNodes="4"/>
----

NOTE: For instance if 4 nodes are running on a given note (often because the host has 4 cores), then
a multi-nodes task that requires 4 nodes might select the 4 workers on this host.

==== Defining a Topology for Multi-Nodes Tasks

In addition to the number of ProActive Nodes you can specify the *nodes network topology*, e.g
the set of nodes within some latency threshold, nodes on the same host and many more.


Here is the list of topologies we support:

* *Arbitrary* topology does not imply any restrictions on nodes location
* *Best proximity* - the set of closest nodes among those which are not executing other tasks.
* *Threshold proximity* - the set of nodes within a threshold proximity (in microseconds).
* *Single Host* - the set of nodes on a single host.
* *Single Host Exclusive* - the set of nodes of a single host exclusively. The host with selected nodes will be reserved for the user.
* *Multiple Hosts Exclusive* - the set of nodes filled in multiple hosts. Hosts with selected nodes will be reserved for the user.
* *Different Hosts Exclusive* - the set of nodes each from a different host. All hosts with selected nodes will be reserved for the user.

=== Handling failures

It’s possible to have errors when your Job is executed. *ProActive Scheduler* provides several mechanisms to deal with exceptional situations in your Jobs.
If a Task contains errors during Job execution, the *Proactive Scheduler* automatically restarts this Task. The number of automatic restarts is defined by the Workflow owner by assigning an integer value to the counter *Number of Automatic Restarts*.
The user also defines *Where he wants that the scheduler restarts In-Error tasks*, i.e., on the same Proactive node or on another Proactive node.

If automatic restarts does not fix errors, the Scheduler applies one of the following Task error management policies, i.e., the one defined by the user during Workflow creation:

* *Ignore error and continue Job execution* - each *In-Error* Task inside the Job transits to *Faulty* and its successor Tasks are executed.

* *Only suspend dependencies of In-Error Tasks* - successor Tasks of each *In-Error* Task are *Pending* until errors are fixed. The Job is in *In-Error* state.
                                               The user can restart *In-Error* Tasks as many times as he wishes.


* *Pause Job execution (running Tasks can terminate)* - successor Tasks of each *In-Error* Task are paused until errors are fixed. The Job is paused.
                                                     The user can restart *In-Error* Tasks as many times as he wishes.

* *Kill Job (running Tasks are killed)* - The Job is killed with all Tasks.


==== Maximum execution time for a task

A `timeout` (also known as `walltime`) can be set at the task's level to stop a task's execution when the timeout is reached.
The general format of the walltime attribute is `[hh:mm:ss]`, where h is hour, m is minute and s is second.
The format still allows for more flexibility. We can define the walltime simply as `5` which corresponds to
5 seconds, `10` is 10 seconds, `4:10` is 4 minutes and 10 seconds, and so on.

The walltime mechanism is started
just before a task is launched. If a task does finish before its walltime, the mechanism is canceled. Otherwise,
the task is terminated. Note that the tasks are terminated without any prior notice.

=== Cron Workflows
The *ProActive Scheduler* allows to schedule <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflows*>> with the <<_glossary_job_planner,*Job Planner*>>.
Find more information in the <<_user_job_planner_service,*Job Planner Service*>> section.


=== Cron Tasks
*ProActive Scheduler* supports the execution of time-based tasks or cron tasks. The users can assign a
cron expression to the `loop` variable of a *Loop* in a ProActive Job. All tasks which belong
that Loop will be executed iteratively and indefinitely. The start time of the next iteration
is the next point of time specified by the cron expression.


==== Cron Expression Syntax
The syntax of the follows the UNIX crontab pattern, a string consists of five space-separated segments.
 Please refer http://www.sauronsoftware.it/projects/cron4j/manual.php#p02[cron4j documentation] for further details.

==== Setting up Cron Tasks
Setting up a cron task requires two steps:

* Define a *Loop* with the desired cron tasks
* Assign a cron expression as the `loop` variable value

Example that prints _Hello_ every 10 minutes:
[source, xml]
----
<job name=”cron_job”>
     <genericInformation>
        <info name="START_AT" value="2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00"/>
    </genericInformation>
    <task name=”cron_task”>
        <scriptExecutable>
            <script>
                <code language="javascript">
                    print("Hello");
                </code>
            </script>
        </scriptExecutable>
        <controlFlow>
            <loop target=”cron_task”>
                <script>
                    loop = “10 * * * *”
                </script>
            <loop>
        </controlFlow>
    </task>
</job>
----

You can find a complete example running a simple task every minutes in this link:examples/cron_task.xml[XML workflow^].

==== Notes

* The execution of the first iteration occurs immediately and does not depend on the cron expression specified.
 However the user can specify a start time for the first iteration using `START_AT` <<_generic_information,generic information>>.
 Its value should be http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601^] compliant.

* Each iteration yields one or more task results and the user can query the job state and task states to
retrieve information of each iteration.

* It is assumed that execution time of each iteration is less that time gap specified by the cron expression.
 If the execution time of an iteration is longer, the execution of the next iteration will occur at next point
  of time with respect to the current time. For instance it is possible to observe lesser number of iteration
   executed within a certain time period than number of expected iterations, if some iterations had take longer finish time.

* If the execution of the task defining the loop (where the <controlFlow> block is defined) fails,
 the cron execution is terminated.

* ProActive Scheduler executes any cron task indefinitely. Therefore the state of ProActive Job will remain
 `RUNNING` unless the cron task execution terminates either by the user (for instance by killing the job
  or the task) or due an error in the task execution.

=== Remote Visualization

Using the Scheduler Web Interface, it is possible to access the display of the ProActive Node running a given task.
First remote visualization must be activated via the
link:../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.html#_rest_api_properties[Scheduler configuration files] (set *novnc.enabled* to true).

NOTE: Remote visualization works via VNC where the REST API will connect to the node running the task, i.e a graphical
application. The VNC output will be forwarded to the your browser and you will be able to interact with the
application.

The task that you want to visualize must output a special string using the following format:
*PA_REMOTE_CONNECTION;JOB_ID;TASK_ID;vnc;HOSTNAME:PORT* where *JOB_ID* must be the current job id, *TASK_ID* the current task id
and *HOSTNAME:PORT* the hostname and port where the VNC server runs.

It is the task's responsibility to print the string.
Here is a link:examples/remote_visualization_script.sh[sample script^] that starts a Xvnc server and runs
 a graphical application.
It can be used in a native task for instance.

In the Scheduler Web Interface, select the running job and use the _Preview_ tab to enable remote visualization.

TIP: Since it runs a graphical application, the task will never exit and run forever. The common use case is that
you want to check manually some results via the graphical application and then exit the application.
The task will then terminate normally.

=== Troubleshoot a Workflow Execution

When a task has *IN_ERROR* status, a right click on it allows the user to select _Mark as finished and resume_. 
This will set the task status as *FINISHED* and then resume job execution: this task won't be executed again, subsequent tasks will execute as if the task executed correctly.
This allows the user to manually perform actions to the *IN_ERROR* task, without cancelling the whole job execution. 


If the task has not *IN_ERROR* status, the _Mark as finished and resume_ option will be in grey, meaning that the action is disabled.

=== Get Notifications on Job Events


Add a "NOTIFICATION_EVENTS" Generic information, to list events on which a user wants to be notified. List is comma-separated and should be taken from(events are not case sensitive):

* *Job change priority*
* *Job In-Error*
* *Job paused*
* *Job pending to finished*
* *Job pending to running*
* *Job restarted from error*
* *Job resumed*
* *Job running to finished*
* *Job submitted*

Scheduler can send email to the users when one of the above events is received.

To enable this functionality, the following properties should be set in `config/scheduler/setting.ini`:

[source, groovy]
----
pa.scheduler.notifications.email.enabled = true
pa.scheduler.notifications.email.from = username@example.com
----

To configure the email sender on Scheduler, the configuration file `config/scheduler/emailnotification.properties` should be filled in.

Notifications will only be sent for jobs whose generic information contains user's email address under the "EMAIL" key. Example:

[source, xml]
----
<genericInformation>
    <info name="EMAIL" value="user@example.com"/>
    <info name="NOTIFICATION_EVENTS" value="Job paused, Job resumed"/>
</genericInformation>
----

=== Chaining Jobs

SubmitJobNoWait and SubmitJobAndWait templates under *Controls* menu allow you to submit a workflow from another workflow using *schedulerapi*.

In order to submit a workflow, you need to put the URL of that workflow in the Task Variables under the key *workflowURL*. You can use any URL that points to
a valid workflow xml file. For example, you can add the workflow that you want to execute into *Catalog*, then retrieve its URL by indicating its Bucket ID
and workflow name. Moreover, SubmitJobAndWait will wait for the completion of the submitted workflow before proceeding further with the execution of the dependant tasks.

=== Control and Validation

In order to better control your workflows, two templates *Web Validation* and *Email Validation* are provided under the *Manuals* menu. These templates aim at validating part of your workflows manually. The tasks after the validation template will only be executed
once you validate it. You can put your description of the validation under the *content* variable in *Web Validation* template, and under *message* variable in *Email Validation* template. Three options are provided, the *Yes* option indicates that you want
to validate the workflow and continue the execution of the rest tasks; the *Maybe* option means that you do not know what to do for the moment; the *No* option denotes that you do not want to validate the workflow, and the remaining of the workflow will be paused.

In order to validate your workflow using *Web Validation*, you need to go to the *ProActive Notification & Validation* portal, the workflow will be validated by clicking on one of the three buttons. By using *Email Validation*, you will receive an email with three links, the workflow can be validated by clicking on one of the links.

=== LDAP Query Tasks

==== Description

This task features the LDAP searching operation.

==== LDAP query task variables table

The next parameters are provided as task variables:
 
[width="100%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter Name | Description | Example
|ldapURL|URL the LDAP server|`ldap://localhost:389` (unsecured) or `ldaps://127.0.0.1:636` (secured)
|ldapDnBase|The base distinguished name of the catalog| `dc=yourOrganization,dc=com`
|ldapUsername|The username | `cn=admin` for global admin or `cn=yourName,ou=users` for a specific user
|ldapSearchBase|base domain name for ldap queries|`dc=specificDepartment` or can be empty for base DN search
|ldapSearchFilter|LDAP search filter|`(objectclass=*)`
|ldapSelectedAttributes|list of attributes to retrieve|`attributeName1,attributeName2`

|===

If any of these variables must stay private you'll need to set them as third-party credentials (details are given below).

==== Authenticate with Third-party credentials

In order to be able to authenticate to the LDAP server you need to define for the right Scheduler user the `ldapPassword` in the <<_third_party_credentials,Third-party credentials>>.



==== Result of task

The task provides a specific variable for the result, which is called `result`.

The <<_retrieve_results, task result >>  is a String in JSON format.


===== Output example 

Successful task :
```{.json}
{"status":"Ok","attributes":[{"loginShell":"/bin/csh","uid":"yaro","userPassword":"[B@2d6a9952","homeDirectory":"/home/users/yaro","uidNumber":"1000","givenName":"yaro","objectClass":"inetOrgPerson","sn":"yaya","gidNumber":"500","cn":"yaro"}]}
```

Failed task :
```{.json}
{"status":"Error","errorMessage":"javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: [LDAP: error code 32 - No Such Object]; remaining name 'cn=yaro,dc=activeeon,dc=com1'"}
```

==== Secure connection to LDAP server

In order to use secure connection for the LDAP server, specify a correct LDAP over SSL URL (for example ldaps://localhost:636).

In order to be able to connect to a LDAP server, a valid certificate is needed.

When a self-signed certificate is used, the certificate needs to be added to the trusted certificates of the JRE provided with the Scheduler.

Below is an example for adding a certificate to a Java cacerts file:
----
keytool -import -alias ldap-self-signed -keystore </pathToScheduler/jre/lib/security/cacerts> -file ldaps.crt -storepass changeit
----

== Workflow Storage and Versioning

The Catalog provides the storage and versioning of Workflows inside Buckets. It also features a searching functionality using a http://graphql.org/[GraphQL] query language to fetch Workflows based on particular parameters. The Catalog is a RESTful service. A http://swagger.io/[Swagger] interface is provided to understand and interact with the service.
First the concepts of the Catalog will be explained. Then it will be provided information how to interact with Catalog from GUI.

=== Bucket concept

A Bucket is a collection of ProActive Objects and in particular ProActive Workflows that can be shared between users. The default settings provide the different Buckets, one of them is:

* Examples (set of Workflows samples publicly readable)

Listing the Catalog for existing Buckets is done using the following HTTP request:

    GET http://localhost:8080/catalog/buckets

It is also possible to list all Workflows inside a particular Bucket using its `bucket_id`:

    GET http://localhost:8080/catalog/buckets/{bucket_id}/resources

Then, we can fetch a particular Workflow based on its `name`:

    GET http://localhost:8080/catalog/buckets/{bucket_id}/resources/{name}

NOTE: By default, the Catalog will always return the latest version of the Workflows.

=== Workflow versioning

The Catalog provides versioning of Workflows. You can list all the revisions of a particular Workflow using the HTTP request:

    GET http://localhost:8080/catalog/buckets/{bucketId}/resources/{name}/revisions

The revision of Workflow is identified by `commit_time`. Commit time specifies the time when the Workflow's version was added in the Catalog.
You can fetch a Workflow detailed metadata information using its `name` and `commit_time`:

    GET http://localhost:8080/catalog/buckets/{bucketId}/resources/{name}/revisions/{commit_time}

A Workflow Revision is created from a ProActive XML <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflow*>> definition.
Beside from the _id_, _name_ and _project_name_ of the Workflow, a few more information are indexed from the XML content such as _<<_generic_information>>_ and _<<_workflow_variables>>_.

More detailed information on how to create or modify Workflows and Buckets are available in the link:../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.html#_catalog[Admin guide].

=== Catalog security and groups management

The Catalog is secured with a sessionId. Every request to the Catalog must have a valid sessionId inside the request header.
The security mechanism is based on groups, the group GROUP:public-objects can be accessed by any user with a valid sessionId. Other groups can be accessed (read and write) if the sessionId corresponds to a user which is part of that group.
As an example, a user which is part of the interns group (GROUP:interns) can see and change buckets and their contents which belong to GROUP:interns.
The user can only access to the buckets list belonging to him or to his group and plus to public buckets (the GROUP:public-objects associated buckets).

The sessionId is validated against the Scheduler REST api, so if the Catalog does not have access (network outage, firewall) to the Scheduler, no access to the Catalog is possible.

=== Retrieving and searching the Workflows

==== Get Workflow from REST API

From REST API it's possible to retrieve the raw content of a specific revision of Workflow. For this case it's required to specify `name` and `commit_time` of the Workflow's  revision:

    GET http://localhost:8080/catalog/buckets/{bucketId}/resources/{name}/revisions/{commit_time}/raw

In order to get the raw content of a last revision of a Workflow use next REST API endpoint:

    GET http://localhost:8080/catalog//buckets/{bucketId}/resources/{name}/raw

In this case you need to provide only the `name` of a Workflow.

NOTE: A complete documentation of the Catalog REST API is available by default on:
  http://localhost:8080/catalog/swagger-ui.html

==== GraphQL usage

http://graphql.org/[GraphQL] is the standardized query language, which  provides opportunity to search and retrieve the Workflow by specified criterion from the Catalog.
NOTE: Please follow the graphiql endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/catalog/graphiql` in order to query for the specific Workflow.

== Usage of Catalog from GUI

The GUI interaction with the Catalog can be done in two places: Studio portal and Workflow Catalog Portal.
The portals follow the concepts of the Catalog: Workflows store inside buckets, the Workflow can have several revisions, each Workflow have specific description.
The view of Workflows from Catalog in Studio and from Workflow Catalog Portal follow the same view logic. The page is separated in 3 sections.
The approach is selecting the needed information from left to right. First user should choose the required bucket, then the user can observe all the Workflows in the selected bucket. When the user select the Workflow it will be shown all existing revisions of the Workflow. By selecting a revision you will be able to see the the description about the workflow revision.

=== Studio
Inside Studio portal there is present a `Catalog` menu. With help of this menu the user can directly interact from studio view with Catalog storage.

==== Publish current Workflow to the Catalog
The Catalog menu will provide possibility for an user directly save inside Catalog the created in studio Workflow: `Publish current Workflow to the Catalog`.
In opened window for publishing the current Workflow to Catalog the user can choose the `Bucket` where the Workflow will be stored and `commit message`.
If the Workflow with the same name is already exists in specified bucket in the Catalog, it will be created the new revision of this Workflow.
We recommend to specify commit message for easier differentiation the versions of a Workflow.

==== Get a Workflow from the Catalog
When the Workflow is selected from Catalog you have two options:
`Open as a new Workflow`
This option will open the Workflow from Catalog as new Workflow in Studio
`Append to current Workflow`
When the user choose this option, it's supposed that the user wants to append the Workflow from Catalog to Workflow already opened inside studio. Please open the Workflow to which you want to append before.

=== Workflow Catalog Portal
The Workflow Catalog Portal provides interfaces for easy administering the Catalog. The most important of provided features will be described next.

==== Creating the new buckets
You need to press `plus` button from above of buckets. In opened window you need to specify Bucket name and associate with user group.
For security reason there are groups associated to buckets. The user from same group can view the content of bucket.
There is a special default group - `no group` in the dropdown list of window. The bucket associated with this default group can be viewed by any user.

==== Removing Workflows inside bucket
For removing Workflows, first the user should select the bucket containing the Workflows. Then the user can select multiple Workflows with pressed CTRL button. To delete the selected Workflows push the `trash` button.

===== Importing/Exporting Workflows into the Catalog
You can export Workflows to an archive, to share them more easily (email, usb key,..), and then import the entire archive from the Catalog.

To export the selected Workflows as a ZIP archive from Workflow Catalog portal: select a bucket, then the targeted Workflows (you can select multiple Workflows with pressed CTRL button). Press "Download Workflows" button from portal view. You'll get a ZIP file that can be transferred on an other Scheduler.
To import the zip archive of Workflows to the Catalog from portal, select the bucket where the Workflows will be added. Then press `Upload Workflows` button in portal and follow the instructions `Upload a ZIP archive of Workflows` opened window.

==== List revisions of Workflow
The last revision of the Catalog is always displayed on the portal. In order to see all revisions of selected Workflow, please click on `clock` button inside description area.
The revisions are shown in chronological order by commit time.

==== Restore the revision
Usually users work on the last version of a workflow. But in some cases, user could need to get back to a specific revision.
For this case there is a dedicated button: `Restore the revision`. Once the workflow is selected, click on the 'clock' button to expand all revisions.
By simply selecting the required revision from list and clicking `Restore`, the selected revision will become the last version of Workflow.


== Third-party credentials

=== Overview

Tasks executed by <<_glossary_practive_scheduler,*ProActive
Scheduler*>> might need to use a password or another kind of
credentials to acces third-party services or applications. For example
a user might wish to pass his MySQL password to Native Task which runs
a `mysql` command to dump a database.

In such cases it is often desireable to store the credentials
separately from the <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflow*>>
definition. *ProActive Scheduler* provides such facility.

Third-party credentials in *ProActive Scheduler* are user-defined
key-value pairs of strings stored on the server side in encrypted
form. The credentals are accessible in the tasks executed by the user
via API (Script and Java Tasks) or variable substitution (arguments of
Native Tasks and parameters of Java Tasks).

=== Managing third-party credentials

Methods to add or remove the credentials and to list the stored
credential keys are exposed in both Java and REST APIs.

End users can manage their credentials using the
<<_glossary_scheduler_web_interface,Scheduler Web Interface>> (Portal
-> Manage third-party credentials) or the
<<_scheduler_command_line,Command Line Interface>>.

==== Example CLI usage

Add credential:

    $ ./bin/proactive-client --put-credential MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD mypassword
    Credential "MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD" successfully stored.

List credentials (only keys are listed):

    $ ./bin/proactive-client --list-credentials
    [...]
    MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD

Remove credential:

    $ ./bin/proactive-client --remove-credential MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD
    Credential "MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD" successfully removed.

=== Using third-party credentials

==== In a Script Task

In a Script Task, the `credentials` map contains all user's
credentials:

[source,groovy]
----
// mysqlPassword will contain the value corresponding to "MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD" key
mysqlPassword = credentials.get('MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD')
----

==== In Java Task

In Java, the method `getThirdPartyCredential` of `JavaExecutable`
returns the credential corresponding to the key passed as parameter:

[source,java]
----
public class PrintAndReturnCredentialsTask extends JavaExecutable {
  @Override
  public Serializable execute(TaskResult... results) throws Throwable {
    // mysqlPassword will contain the value corresponding to "MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD" key
    String mysqlPassword = getThirdPartyCredential("MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD");
    [...]
  }
}
----

Another way to use credentials in Java tasks is via parameters. If a
parameter contains a string of the form `$credentials_<credential
key>`, the string is replaced with the value of the corresponding
credential:

[source,xml]
----
<task name="...">
  <javaExecutable class="...">
    <parameters>
      <!-- mysqlPassword will contain the value corresponding to "MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD" key -->
      <parameter name="mysqlPassword" value="$credentials_MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD"/>
    </parameters>
  </javaExecutable>
</task>
----

==== In a Native Task

Finally, a credential can be passed to a Native Task via
argumens. Note that, as with Java Task parameters, the `$credentials_`
prefix is necessary. In the example below, `/bin/echo` will be called
with the value corresponding to the key `MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD` (if the
key is not present, no replacement occurs):

[source,xml]
----
<task name="Task1">
  <nativeExecutable>
    <staticCommand value="/bin/echo" >
      <arguments>
        <argument value="$credentials_MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD"/>
      </arguments>
    </staticCommand>
  </nativeExecutable>
</task>
----

== Scheduler and DataSpace APIs
From a ProActive task, several APIs are accessible via Java objects bound to dedicated variables:

- Scheduler API : using the "schedulerapi" variable, it is possible to interact directly with the scheduler and do several operations such as submitting jobs, waiting for tasks, listing running jobs etc.
- DataSpace API : the "userspaceuri" or "globalspaceuri" variables allow to manipulate files present in User or Global spaces. Operations include listing, uploading, downloading, or deleting files.

=== Scheduler API

From inside a task script, you can use the Scheduler API variable like the following:

[source,groovy]
----
// importing necessary classes
import org.ow2.proactive.scheduler.common.job.*
import org.ow2.proactive.scheduler.common.task.*
import org.ow2.proactive.scripting.*


// connect to the scheduler
schedulerapi.connect()

// create a hello world job
job = new TaskFlowJob()
job.setName("HelloJob")
task = new ScriptTask()

=== DataSpace API

The traditional way to transfer files from the user or global space to a task is by using file transfer directives as described in chapter <<_data_spaces>>.

Where file transfer directives are sufficient to cover usual cases, it is sometimes necessary to manipulate directly the dataspace API to have a finer control level.

Below is an example use of this api :

[source,groovy]
----
// connect to the user space
userspaceapi.connect()

// push file
inFile = new File("inFile.txt");
inFile.write("HelloWorld")
userspaceapi.pushFile(inFile, "remoteDir/inFile.txt")

// list files

remotefiles = userspaceapi.listFiles("remoteDir", "*.txt"
println remotefiles

// pull File
outFile = new File("outFile.txt")
userspaceapi.pullFile("remote/inFile.txt", outFile)

println outFile.text

== Fork environment
A fork execution environment is a new Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which is started exclusively to execute a task. Starting a
new JVM means that the task inside it will run in a new environment. This environment can
be set up by the creator of the task. A new JVMs is set up with a new classpath,
new system properties and more customization.

=== Docker fork execution environment
A Docker fork execution environment executes a JVM inside a Docker container. Hence the task
which is executes in the Docker fork execution environment can be customized by the JVM settings
and by the tool-set and isolation provided by Docker containers.

TIP: If your task needs to install new software or updates software, then run it inside a Docker container.
That way other tasks will not be affected by changes, because Docker containers provide isolation so that
the host machine's software stays the same.

==== How to use a fork execution Environment
Select Docker in the ‘Fork Execution Environment’ Dropdown:
sample Docker environment settings will appear.

That settings ensure, that the current task is executed inside a Docker container, or fail if Docker is
 not installed or the user has no permission to run Docker containers.

TIP: If the executing Node has no Docker installed, the task will fail. Selection Scripts can ensure
that tasks are executed only on Nodes which have Docker installed.

===== Procedure
The Fork Environment Script exports a variable `preJavaHomeCmd`, which is picked up by the Node that
 executes the Task. That variable is supposed to be a Docker run command inside a string.
  That string will be split by space and added in front of the fork execution command. As an example:
----
/usr/bin/java -cp [Classpath] [ExecutedClass]
----
And the Docker run command is:
----
docker run java
----
Then both will be combined to:
----
 docker run java /usr/bin/java -cp [Classpath] [ExecutedClass]
----

The combined command will execute a JVM inside a docker container.
Internally the command is split into docker, run, java, /usr/bin/java, -cp, [Classpath], [ExecutedClass].
 That is important to know because the fork execution command is split by spaces.
  That means, that paths can’t contain spaces. The Docker container mounts the ProActive home and a
   folder in the temp directory of the operating system. Those cannot contain spaces, because if they
    do then the fork execution command will be split wrong and fail.
