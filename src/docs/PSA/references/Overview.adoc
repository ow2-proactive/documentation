*ProActive Service Automation (PSA)* allows automating service deployment, together with their life-cycle management. Services are instantiated by workflows (executed as a Job by the Scheduler), and related workflows allow to move instances from a state to another one.

At any point in time, each Service Instance has a specific State (RUNNING, ERROR, FINISHED, etc.).

Attached to each Service Instance, PSA service stores some information such as:
Service Instance Id, Service Id, Service Instance State, the ordered list of Jobs executed for the Service, a set of variables with their values (a map that includes for instance the service endpoint), etc.
