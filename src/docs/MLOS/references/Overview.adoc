*Machine Learning Open Studio (ML-OS)* is an interactive graphical interface that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. It provides a rich set of generic machine learning tasks that can be connected together to build either basic or complex machine learning workflows for various use cases such as: fraud detection, text analysis, online offer recommendations, prediction of equipment failures, facial expression analysis, etc.

Machine Learning Open Studio is open source and allows easy task parallelization, running them on resources matching constraints (Multi-CPU, GPU, data locality, library).
