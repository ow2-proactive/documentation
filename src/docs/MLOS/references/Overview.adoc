*Machine Learning Open Studio (ML OS)* is an interactive visual interface that allows to easily build, deploy, and test predictive on your data. It provides different tasks, for instance, import data, export data,
 save model, load a trained model, train prediction, and evaluate a model, etc. These tasks enable the
 user to develop powerful machine learning solutions, such as: fraud detection, text analysis, online offer
 recommendations, prediction of equipment failures, facial expression analysis, etc.

Proactive Machine Learning Open Studio is open source and allows easy task parallelization, running them on resources matching constraints (Multi-CPU, GPU, data locality, library).
