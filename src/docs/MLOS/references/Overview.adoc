*Proactive Machine Learning (PML)* is a complete DSML platform (Data Science and Machine Learning) including a ML Studio, AutoML, Data Science Orchestration and MLOps for the deployment,
training, execution and scalability of artificial intelligence and machine learning models on
any type of infrastructure. Created for data scientists and ML engineers, the solution is simple to use and accelerates machine learning algorithms toward production.

Proactive Machine Learning platform provides a rich set of generic machine learning tasks that can be connected together to build either basic or complex machine learning workflows for various use cases such as: fraud detection, text analysis, online offer recommendations, prediction of equipment failures, facial expression analysis, etc.
PML workflows enable users to manage machine learning pipelines through development lifecycle and allow easy task parallelization, running them on resources matching constraints (Multi-CPU, GPU, data locality, library).
