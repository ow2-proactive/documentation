==== Statistics on ProActive Jobs and Resource Usage

This addon generates a gantt chart to visualize executions of jobs and tasks, per node and over the time.

This chart can be generated on-demand, running Gantt_chart workflow from the Analytics bucket in the Catalog. 

WARNING: Please note that to run properly, this workflow requires a third party credential named "SCHEDULER_PASSWORD" with your scheduler password (so the tool can connect to the scheduler and retrieve information to build the chart) See <<Managing third-party credentials>>
