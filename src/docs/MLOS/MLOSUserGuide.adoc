== Create a First Predictive Solution

Suppose you need to predict houses prices based on this information (features) provided by the estate agency:

- *CRIM* per capita crime rate by town
- *ZN* proportion of residential lawd zoned for lots over 25000
- *INDUS* proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- *CHAS* Charles River dummy variable
- *NOX* nitric oxides concentration
- *RM* average number of rooms per dwelling
- *AGE* proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- *DIS* weighted distances to five Boston Employment centres
- *RAD* index of accessibility to radial highways
- *TAX* full-value property-tax rate per $10 000
- *PTRATIO* pupil-teacher ratio by town
- *B* 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
- *LSTAT* % lower status of the population
- *MDEV* Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000' s

Predicting houses prices is a complex problem, but we can simplify it a bit for this step by step example. We'll show you how you can easily create a predictive analytics solution using Machine Learning Open Studio.

=== Manage the Canvas

To use Machine Learning Open Studio, you need to add the *Machine Learning Bucket* as main catalog in the ProActive Studio. This bucket contains a set of generic tasks that enables you to upload and prepare data, train a model and test it.

A. Open http://try.activeeon.com/studio[ProActive Workflow Studio^] home page.

B. Create a new workflow.

C. Fill the Workflow `General Parameters`.

D. Click on `Catalog` menu then `Set Bucket as Main Catalog Menu` and select `machine-learning` bucket.
This can also be achieved by adding `/templates/machine-learning` at the end of the URL of the proActive workflow studio.

E. Click on `Catalog` menu then `Add Bucket as Extra Catalog Menu` and select `data-visualization` bucket.

F. Organize your canvas.

NOTE: Set Bucket as Main Catalog Menu allows the user to change the bucket used to get workflows from the Catalog in the studio. By selecting a bucket, the user can change the content of the main Catalog menu (named as the current bucket) to get workflows from another bucket as templates.

image::manage_canvas.gif[100000,2000]

=== Upload Data

To upload data into the Workflow, you need to use a dataset stored in a CSV file.

A. Once your dataset has been converted to *CSV* format, upload it into a cloud storage service for example https://www.aws.amazon.com/s3‎[Amazon S3^]. For this tutorial, we will use Boston house prices dataset available on this link:
https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/activeeon-public/datasets/boston-houses-prices.csv

B. Drag and drop the <<Import_Data>> task from the *machine-learning* bucket in the ProActive Workflow Studio.

C. Click on the task and click `General Parameters` in the left to change the default parameters of this task.

D. Put in *FILE_URL* variable the S3 link to upload your dataset.

E. Set the other parameters according to your dataset format.

This task uploads the data into the workflow that we can for model training and testing.

If you want to skip these steps, you can directly use the <<Load_Boston_Dataset>> Task by a simple drag and drop.

image::upload_data.gif[100000,2000]

=== Prepare Data

This step consists of preparing the data for the training and testing of the predictive model. So in this example, we will simply split our datset into two separate datasets: one for training and one for testing.

To do this, we use the <<Split_Data>> Task in the machine_learning bucket.

A. Drag and drop the <<Split_Data>> Task into the canvas, and connect it to the <<Import_Data>> or <<Load_Boston_Dataset>> Task.

B. By default, the ratio is 0.7 this means that 70% of the dataset will be used for training the model and 0.3 for testing it.

C. Click the <<Split_Data>> Task and set the *TRAIN_SIZE* variable to 0.6.

image::prepare_data.gif[100000,2000]

=== Train a Predictive Model

Using Machine Learning Open Studio, you can easily create different machine learning models in a single experiment and compare their results. This type of experimentation helps you find the best solution for your problem.
You can also enrich the `machine-learning` bucket by adding new machine learning algorithms and publish or customize an existing task according to your requirements as the tasks are open source.

NOTE: To change the code of a task click on it and click the `Task Implementation`. You can also add new variables to a specific task.

In this step, we will create two different types of models and then compare their scores to decide which algorithm is most suitable to our problem. As the Boston dataset used for this example consists of predicting price of houses (continuous label). As such, we need to deal with a regression predictive problem.

To solve this problem, we have to choose a regression algorithm to train the predictive model. To see the available regression algorithms available on the Machine Learning Open Studio, see *ML Regression* Section in the *machine-learning* bucket.

For this example, we will use <<Linear_Regression>> Task and <<Support_Vector_Regression>> Task.

A. Find the <<Linear_Regression>> Task and <<Support_Vector_Regression>> Task and drag them into the canvas.

B. Find the <<Train_Model>> Task and drag it twice into the canvas.

C. Connect the <<Split_Data>> Task to  the two <<Train_Model>> Tasks in order to give it access to the training data. Connect then the <<Linear_Regression>> Task to the first <<Train_Model>> Task and <<Support_Vector_Regression>> to the second <<Train_Model>> Task.

D. To be able to download the model learned by each algorithm, drag two <<Import_Model>> Tasks and connect them to each <<Train_Model>> Task.

image::train.gif[100000,2000]

=== Test the Predictive Model

To evaluate the two learned predictive models, we will use the testing data that was separated out by the <<Split_Data>> Task to score our trained models. We can then compare the results of the two models to see which generated better results.

A. Find the <<Predict_Model>> Task and drag and drop it twice into the canvas.

B. Connect the first <<Predict_Model>> Task to the <<Train_Model>> Task that is connected to <<Support_Vector_Regression>> Task.

C. Connect the second <<Predict_Model>> Task to the <<Train_Model>> Task that is connected to <<Linear_Regression>> Task.

D. Find the <<Export_Results>> Task in the Machine Learning bucket and drag and drop it twice into the canvas.

E. Connect each <<Export_Results>> Task with <<Predict_Model>>.

image::test.gif[100000,2000]

NOTE: if you have a pickled file (.pkl) containing a predictive model that you have learned using another platform and you need to test it in the Machine Learning Open Studio, you can load it using *Import_Model* Task.

=== Run the Experiment and Preview the Results

Now the workflow is completed, let's execute it by:

A. Click the *Execute* button on the menu to run the workflow.

B. Click the *Scheduling & Orchestration* button to track the workflow execution progress.

C. Click the Visualization tab and track the progress of your workflow execution (a green check mark appears on each Task when its execution is finished).

D. Visualize the output logs by clicking on the output tab and check the streaming check box.

E. Click the *Tasks* tab, select an *Export_Results* task and click on the *Preview* tab, then click either on *Open in browser* to preview the results on your browser or on *Save as file* to download the results locally.

image::execute.gif[100000,2000]

== Customize the Machine Learning Bucket

=== Create or Update a ML Task

*Machine Learning Bucket* contains various open source tasks that can be easily used by a simple drag and drop.

It is possible to enrich the Machine Learning Bucket by adding your own tasks. (see section 4.3)

It is also possible to customize the code of the generic Machine Learning tasks. In this case, you need to drag and drop the targeted task to modify its code in the *Task Implementation* section.

NOTE: It is also possible to add or/and delete variables of each task, set your own fork environments etc. More details available on https://www.activeeon.com/public_content/documentation/latest/user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_studio_tasks[Proactive User Guide^]

=== Set the Fork Environment

A fork execution environment is a new Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which is started exclusively to execute a task. Starting a new JVM means that the task inside it will run in a new environment. This environment can be set up by the creator of the task. A new JVMs is set up with a new classpath, new system properties and more customization.

We used a `Docker fork environment` for all the Machine Learning tasks. *activeeon/dlm3* was used as a docker container for all tasks. If your task needs to install new Machine Learning libraries which are not available in this container, then, use your own docker container or an appropriate environment with the needed libraries.

NOTE: The use of docker containers is recommended as that way other tasks will not be affected by change. Docker containers provide isolation so that the host machine’s software stays the same. More details available on https://www.activeeon.com/public_content/documentation/latest/user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_fork_environment[Proactive User Guide^]

=== Publish a ML Task

The `Catalog` menu provides the possibility for a user to publish newly created or/and update tasks inside *Machine Learning Bucket*, you need just to click on `Catalog` Menu then `Publish current Workflow to the Catalog`.
Choose `machine-leaning` Bucket to store your newly added workflow on it.
If the Task with the same name already exists in the 'machine-leaning' bucket, then, it will be updated.
We recommend to submit Tasks with a commit message for easier differentiation between the different submitted versions.

NOTE: More details available on https://www.activeeon.com/public_content/documentation/latest/user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_publish_current_workflow_to_the_catalog[ProActive User Guide^]

=== Create a ML Workflow

The link:http://try.activeeon.com/tutorials/quickstart/quickstart.html[quickstart tutorial, window="_blank"] on link:http://try.activeeon.com[try.activeeon.com, window="_blank"]
shows you how to build a simple workflow using ProActive Studio.

We show below an example of a workflow created with the Studio:

image::ML_Workflow_Example.png[align="center"]

At the left part, are illustrated the **General Parameters** of the workflow with the following information:

- `Name`: the name of the workflow.
- `Project`: the project name to which belongs the workflow.
- `Description`: the textual description of the workflow.
- `Documentation`: if the workflow has a Generic Information named "Documentation", then its URL value is displayed as a link.
- `Job Priority`: the priority assigned to the workflow. It is by default set to `NORMAL`, but can be increased or decreased once the job is submitted.

NOTE: The workflow represented in the above is available on the 'machine-learning-workflows' bucket.
