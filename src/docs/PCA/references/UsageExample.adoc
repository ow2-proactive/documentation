In this section, we show how to start a PCA service and how to use actions that manage its life cycle. To do that, we choose MongoDB PCA service as a running example.

- *Start MongoDB*

To start the mongoDB service, you have to go to the cloud automation section in the automation dashboard portal and choose MongoDB service from the service activation tab.
At this point, you can provide values for variables that help configure this service then press execute.

Once the MongoDB service is deployed, the state of the instance becomes RUNNING.
At this stage, you can interact with the database provided by this PCA service.
For this, you might need a host and a port number that can be retrieved from the endpoint displayed in the info window as shown bellow:

Two actions are possible at this step; pause or finish the instance.

- *Pause MongoDB*

The running instance can be paused by executing the pause action when the instance is in the RUNNING state.
The pause action suspends only processes in the specified containers to release resources without losing data/container.

From the pause state, two actions are possible; resume or finish the instance.

- *Resume MongoDB*

The resume action allows to restart a paused instance while preserving previous state of the database. The instance is the RUNNING state.

- *Finish MongoDB*

When the user does not need this PCA service anymore, he can delete it to release resources using the finish action.
This action can be applied when the instance is in the RUNNING or PAUSED state.
