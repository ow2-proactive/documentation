The following terms are used as ProActive Cloud Automation (PCA) definitions and main concepts:

[[_definition_Service]]
Service::
A set of workflows representing Actions and having the same Service ID.

[[_definition_Activated_Service]]
Activated Service or Service Instance::
An Activated Service is an Instance of a Service. It is characterized by a Service ID and an Instance ID.

[[_definition_Action]]
Action::
An Action will launch a workflow on a Service Instance modifying its State. An action is characterized by <a Service ID + a workflow ID + a state>. The Service ID and the State are respectively named « pca.service.id » and « pca.states » in the list of the workflow Generic Information.

An Action goes from an initial State and conducts to a target State after the Transition is completed.
As an Action must be deterministic, for an given initial State it can conduct to a unique target state.

There are three specific kinds of Actions: 

- *Activation:* to start a Service Instance (from the State VOID to a defined State)
- *Finishing:* to stop a Service Instance (from a defined State to the State FINISHED)
- *Killing:* PCA is trying to force a Service Instance to terminate (from a defined State to the State KILLED) 

[[_definition_States]]
States::
The specific States that are pre-defined in ProActive Cloud Automation are VOID, FINISHED, ERROR, KILLED.

- *VOID* Implicit State before a Service is activated
- *FINISHED* Implicit State after a Service is terminated/no longer activated
- *ERROR* Implicit State after something wrong happened
- *KILLED* When PCA abnormally forces an Activated Service to terminate.

NOTE: Please note that users are free to define their own custom States (e.g. RUNNING, SUSPENDED, ...)

[[_definition_Endpoints]]
Endpoints::
Endpoints are a list of (Key,Value) defined in the Variables.
  e.g. [(Swarm, <smarmendpoint>), (HDFS, <hdfs-endpoint>), (Spark, <spark-endpoint>)]

[[_definition_Service_Name_Infrastructure_Name]]
Service_Name, Infrastructure_Name::
Service_Name, Infrastructure_Name are Service specific. If a Service wants/needs them, they can be stored in the data associated to the service to give a name to the service, to identify the infrastructure where the Service Instance will be deployed.
