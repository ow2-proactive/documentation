*Node source policy* is a set of rules and conditions which describes when and how many nodes have to be acquired or released. Policies use node source API to manage the node acquisition.

Node sources were designed in a way that:

* All logic related to node acquisition is encapsulated in the infrastructure manager.
* Conditions and rules of node acquisition is described in the node source policy.
* Permissions to the node source. Each policy has two parameters:
** nodeUsers - utilization permission defined who can get nodes for computations from this node source.
 It has to take one of the following values:
*** +ME+ - Only the node source creator
*** +users=user1,user2;groups=group1,group2;tokens=t1,t2+ - Only specific users, groups or tokens.
 I.e. users=user1 - node access is limited to user1; users=user1;groups=group1 - node access is limited to
 user1 and all users from group group1; users=user1;tokens=t1 - node access is limited to user1 or anyone
 who specified token t1. If node access is protected by a token, node will not be found by the resource
 manager (getNodes request) unless the corresponding token is specified. To exclude specific users or groups
 use users=!user1,!user2;groups=!group1,!group2. Tokens can not be excluded, and mixing inclusion with exclusion
 is not permitted (i.e. users=user1,!user2;groups=!group1,group2).
*** +ALL+ - Everybody
** nodeProviders - Provider permission defines who can add nodes to this node source. It should take one of the following values:
*** +ME+ - Only the node source creator
*** +users=user1,user2;groups=group1,group2+ - Only specific users or groups (for our example user1,
user2, group1 and group2). It is possible to specify only groups or only users.
*** +ALL+ - Everybody
* The user created the node source is the administrator of this node source. It can add and removed
nodes to it, remove the node source itself, but cannot use nodes if usage policy is set to +PROVIDER+
or +PROVIDER_GROUPS+ (unless it's granted AllPermissions).
* New infrastructure manager or node source policy can be dynamically plugged into the Resource Manager.
 In order to do that, it is just required to add new implemented classes in the class path and update
 corresponding list in the configuration file (+PROACTIVE_HOME/config/rm/nodesource+).

===== Static Policy

*Static node source policy* starts node acquisition when nodes are added
to the node source and never removes them. Nevertheless, nodes can be
removed by user request. To use this policy, you have to precise the following parameters:

    computations from this node source. It has to take one of the
    following values:

        users or groups (for our example user1, user2, group1 and
        group2). It is possible to specify only groups or only users.

    nodes. If it is true, nodes will be released without waiting the end
    of jobs running on (default is false).

-   +forceDeployment+ - If for the example above (the deployment
    starts every day at 12.00 and the removal starts at 13.00) you are
    creating the node source at 12.30 the next deployment will take
    place the next day. If you'd like to force the immediate deployment
    set this parameter to true.

===== Remove Nodes When Scheduler Is Idle

*"Remove nodes when scheduler is idle" policy* removes all nodes from
the infrastructure when the scheduler is idle and acquires them when a
new job is submitted. This policy may be useful if there is no need to
keep nodes alive permanently. Nodes will be released after a specified
"idle time". This policy will use a listener of the scheduler, that is
why its URL, its user name and its password have to be specified.
To use this policy, you have to precise the following parameters:

-   +nodeUsers+ - utilization permission defined who can get nodes for
    computations from this node source. It has to take one of the
    following values:

**   +ME+ - Only the node source creator

**   +users=user1,user2;groups=group1,group2+ - Only specific
        users or groups (for our example user1, user2, group1 and
        group2). It is possible to specify only groups or only users.

    this node source. It should take one of the following values:

**   +ME+ - Only the node source creator

**   +users=user1,user2;groups=group1,group2+ - Only specific
        users or groups (for our example user1, user2, group1 and
        group2). It is possible to specify only groups or only users.

**   +ALL+ - Everybody

-   +schedulerURL+ - URL of the Scheduler

-   +schedulerCredentialsPath+ - Path to the credentials used for
    scheduler authentication.

-   +idleTime+ - idle time in millisecond to wait before removing all
    nodes (default is 60000).


===== Scheduler Loading Policy

*Scheduler loading policy* acquires/releases nodes according to the
scheduler loading factor. This policy allows to configure the number of
resources which will be always enough for the scheduler. Nodes are
acquired and released according to scheduler loading factor which is a
number of tasks per node.

It is important to correctly configure maximum and minimum nodes that this
policy will try to hold. Maximum number should not be greater than
potential nodes number which is possible to deploy to underlying
infrastructure. If there are more currently acquired nodes than
necessary, policy will release them one by one after having waited for a
"release period" delay. This smooth release procedure is implemented
because deployment time is greater than the release one. Thus, this
waiting time deters policy from spending all its time trying to deploy
nodes.

To use this policy, you have to precise the following parameters:

-   +nodeUsers+ - utilization permission defined who can get nodes for
    computations from this node source. It has to take one of the
    following values:

**   +ME+ - Only the node source creator

**   +users=user1,user2;groups=group1,group2+ - Only specific
        users or groups (for our example user1, user2, group1 and
        group2). It is possible to specify only groups or only users.

    scheduler authentication.

- +refreshTime+ - time between each calculation of the number of needed
nodes.

- +minNodes+ - Minimum number of nodes to deploy

- +maxNodes+ - Maximum number of nodes to deploy

- +loadFactor+ - number of tasks per node. Actually, if this number is
*N*, it does not means that there will be exactly *N* tasks executed on
each node. This factor is just used to compute the total number of
nodes. For instance, let us assume that this factor is 3 and that we
schedule 100 tasks. In that case, we will have 34 (= upper bound of
100/3) started nodes. Once one task finished and the refresh time
passed, one node will be removed since 99 divided by 3 is 33. When there
will remain 96 tasks (assuming that no other tasks are scheduled
meanwhile), an other node will be removed at the next calculation time,
and so on and so forth...

- +nodeDeploymentTimeout+ - The node deployment timeout.

===== Cron Load Based Policy

The *Cron load based policy* triggers new nodes acquisition when
scheduler is overloaded (exactly like with *"Scheduler loading" policy*)
only within a time slot defined using crontab syntax. All other time the
nodes are removed from the resource manager.

-   +nodeUsers+ - utilization permission defined who can get nodes for
    computations from this node source. It has to take one of the
    following values:

**   +ME+ - Only the node source creator

**   +users=user1,user2;groups=group1,group2+ - Only specific
        users or groups (for our example user1, user2, group1 and
        group2). It is possible to specify only groups or only users.

nodes. If it is true, nodes will be released without waiting the end of
jobs running on (default is false).

resources considering that EC2 instances are paid by the hour.
To use this policy, you have to precise the following parameters:

    computations from this node source. It has to take one of the
    following values:

**   +ME+ - Only the node source creator

**   +users=user1,user2;groups=group1,group2+ - Only specific
        users or groups (for our example user1, user2, group1 and

- +schedulerURL+ - URL of the Scheduler

- +schedulerCredentialsPath+ - Path to the credentials used for

- +preemptive+ - Preemptive parameter indicates the way of releasing
nodes. If it is true, nodes will be released without waiting the end of
jobs running on (default is false).

- +refreshTime+ - time between each calculation of the number of needed
nodes.

- +loadFactor+ - number of tasks per node. Actually, if this number is
*N*, it does not means that there will be exactly *N* tasks executed on
each node. This factor is just used to compute the total number of
nodes. For instance, let us assume that this factor is 3 and that we

passed, one node will be removed since 99 divided by 3 is 33. When there
will remain 96 tasks (assuming that no other tasks are scheduled
meanwhile), an other node will be removed at the next calculation time,
and so on and so forth...

- +releaseDelay+ - Delay between each node release. This time is useful
since the deploying time is important. Let us assume that a node has to
be removed. If this releaseDelay did not exist (or if it was set to 0),
this node would be removed instantaneously. Let us assume assume that
right after this removal, another task is scheduled, requiring a new
node. In that case, we would lose a lot of time removing the previous
node and deploying another one whereas the task could have been
scheduled on the same node. This releaseDelay therefore represents the
time to wait before effectively removing a node.
