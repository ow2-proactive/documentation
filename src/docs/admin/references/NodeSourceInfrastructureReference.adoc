A *Node Source Infrastructure*, also called *Infrastructure Manager*, is responsible for deploying ProActive Nodes inside a defined <<_deploy_nodes_from_proactive_rm,*Node Source*>>. In most of the cases, it knows how to launch a set of ProActive Nodes
on a remote machine. For instance the SSH infrastructure manager connects via SSH to a remote machine and launches
nodes.

When creating a node source, a Node Source Infrastructure and a <<_node_source_policies,Node Source Policy>> must be chosen.

NOTE: New Node Source Infrastructures can be dynamically plugged into the Resource Manager. In order to do that, it is required to add classes extending the link:../javadoc/org/ow2/proactive/resourcemanager/nodesource/infrastructure/InfrastructureManager.html[InfrastructureManager class] in the server class path and update the infrastructure implementation list in the configuration file (+PROACTIVE_HOME/config/rm/nodesource/infrastructures+).

Node Sources can be created using the Resource Manager portal or the command line (see <<_command_line_examples>> for more information).

WARNING: When using the command line, the order of parameters is important, and each infrastructure section below describes the correct parameter order. Each section shows as well the fully qualified name of the infrastructure, to pass on the command line. On the Resource Manager portal, the order of parameters displayed on the interface is slightly different as parameters are grouped into categories.

==== Default Infrastructure

*Full name:* `org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.DefaultInfrastructureManager`

*Default Infrastructure* is designed to be used with ProActive
agent. It cannot perform an automatic deployment but any users
(including an agent) can add already existing nodes into it. In order to
create a node source with this infrastructure, use the Resource Manager portal or run the following
command:

    $ PROACTIVE_HOME/bin/proactive-client --createns defaultns -infrastructure org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.DefaultInfrastructureManager

This infrastructure has no parameter.

==== Local Infrastructure

*Full name:* `org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.LocalInfrastructure`

*Local Infrastructure* can be used to start nodes locally, i.e,
on the host running the Resource Manager. In order to create a node
source with this infrastructure, use the Resource Manager portal or run the following command:

==== CLI Infrastructure

*Full name:* `org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.CLIInfrastructure`

This generic infrastructure allows to deploy nodes using deployment
script written in arbitrary language. The infrastructure just launches
this script and waits until the ProActive node is registered in the
Resource Manager. Command line infrastructure could be used when you
prefer to describe the deployment process using shell scripts instead of
Java. Script examples can be found in
+PROACTIVE_HOME/samples/scripts/deployment+. The deployment script has 4
parameters: +HOST_NAME+, +NODE_NAME+, +NODE_SOURCE_NAME+, +RM_URL+. The
removal script has 2 parameters: +HOST_NAME+ and +NODE_NAME+.

This infrastructure needs 7 arguments, described hereafter:

    Resource Manager.

==== EC2 Infrastructure

*Full name:* `org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.AWSEC2Infrastructure`

The Elastic Compute Cloud, aka *EC2*, is an Amazon Web Service, that
allows its users to use machines (instances) on demand on the cloud. An
EC2 instance is a Xen virtual machine, running on different kinds of
hardware, at different prices, but always paid by the hour, allowing
lots of flexibility. Being virtual machines, instances can be launched
using custom operating system images, called *AMI* (Amazon Machine
Image). For the Resource Manager to use EC2 instances as computing
nodes, a specific EC2 Infrastructure as well as AMI creation utilities
are provided.

===== Pre-Requisites

The configuration of the AWS EC2 infrastructure is subjected to several requirements.

1. The administrator needs both an *AWS access key* and an *AWS secret access key* to enable ProActive to authenticate against AWS.
    Please refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#Using_CreateAccessKey[the AWS documentation] to learn how to get them.

2. The permissions for using a supported *AWS region*.
    Currently we only support the following AWS regions: ap-south-1, eu-west-3, eu-west-2, eu-west-1, ap-northeast-2, ap-northeast-1, sa-east-1, ca-central-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, eu-central-1, us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-1, us-west-2.

3. Enough resources quota (including the number of instances, subnets, key pairs, etc) for creating your node source underlying instances.
    The number of maximum allocated instances is to be configured by the administrator,
    but has also to comply with the limitation of the regions.
    Detailed information is available on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_ec2[Amazon EC2 Limits Documentation].

4. The administrator must be in possession of a valid *AMI ID* to provision instances operating ProActive node.
    Currently we only support the Linux operating system for AWS.

5. The Resource Manager should be accessible from the AWS cloud.
    Please consider replacing PNP by PAMR as communication protocol if the Resource Manager is located behind a NAT gateway.
    You can get additional information about the PAMR protocol in the section <<_installation_on_a_cluster_with_firewall>>.

===== Infrastructure Configuration

To use a cluster of AWS instances as a computing resource for the ProActive scheduler, the administrator has to create a node source in the Resource Manager with the *AWSEC2Infrastructure* profile.
The configuration form exposes the following fields:

-   *awsKey*: Your AWS access key ID (e.g., AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) which is retrieved in the section <<_pre_requisites, Pre-Requisites>>.

-   *awsSecretKey*: Your AWS secret access key (e.g., wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY) retrieved in the section <<_pre_requisites, Pre-Requisites>>.

-   *numberOfInstances*: Total number of AWS instances (i.e., Virtual Machines) to create for this infrastructure.

-   *numberOfNodesPerInstance*: Total number of ProActive Nodes to deploy in each created AWS instance.

+
TIP: If all the nodes of an AWS instance are removed, the instance will be terminated. For more information on the terminated state in AWS please see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html[AWS Terminating Instances].
+

-   *image*: Defines which VM image (AMI) will be used to create the AWS instances.
        The value to provide is the AWS region together with the unique AMI ID, for example: `eu-west-1/ami-bff32ccc`.
        This is an optional property. When no image is specified by the user, the default value `eu-west-3/ami-03bca18cb3dc173c9` is used.
        Make sure the image is from a supported region (listed in the section <<_pre_requisites,Pre-Requisites>>) and using Linux operating system.
        More information about finding a Linux AMI ID is available on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/finding-an-ami.html[AWS EC2 guide for finding an AMI].

-   *vmUsername*: Specifies the default username of the VM image. This username is used to connect to AWS instances.
        Note that you should specify a username already provided in your VM image.
        If you are using a public AMI provided by Amazon Web Service, you can find the default username of your image https://alestic.com/2014/01/ec2-ssh-username/[here].
        This is an optional property. When it is not specified, the default value `ubuntu` is used.

-   *vmKeyPairName*: Defines the name of the AWS key pair for accessing AWS instances.
        This is an optional property. When it's not specified, a default key pair will be created or reused in the given region of the deployment.
        If specified, the key pair must exit in AWS in the region of deployment, and the `vmPrivateKey` must be specified as well.

-   *vmPrivateKey*: Defines the AWS private key file (a `.pem` file) corresponding to 'vmKeyPairName' for accessing AWS instances.
        This is an optional property. When it's not specified, a default key pair will be created or reused in the given region of the deployment.
        If specified, the name of the key pair (`vmKeyPairName`) to which this private key belongs to must be specified as well.

-   *ram*: The minimum required amount of RAM (expressed in Mega Bytes) for each AWS instance that needs to be created.
        This is an optional property. If not provided, the default value `2048` will be used.

-   *cores*: The minimum required amount of virtual cores for each AWS instance that needs to be created.
        This is an optional property. If not provided, the default value `2` will be used.

+
WARNING: If the combination between RAM and CORES does not match any existing AWS instance type, then the closest to the specified parameters will be selected.
+

// -   *spotPrice:* The maximum price that you are willing to pay per hour per instance (your bid price). Amazon EC2 Spot instances allow you to bid on spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity. Since Spot instances are often available at a discount compared to On-Demand pricing. If your bid price is greater than the current Spot price for the specified instance, and the specified instance is available, your request is fulfilled immediately. Otherwise, the request is fulfilled whenever the Spot price falls below your bid price or the specified instance becomes available. Spot instances run until you terminate them or until Amazon EC2 must terminate them (also known as a Spot instance interruption). More information available on https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/[AWS EC2 Spot]

-   *securityGroupIds*: This option allows you to specify the id(s) of the security group(s) configured as a virtual firewall(s) to control inbound and outbound traffic for the EC2 instances hosting the ProActive nodes.
        This is an optional property. If not provided, a security group will be automatically created and used.
        More information regarding Amazon EC2 Security Group available on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html[AWS EC2 Security Groups].

-   *subnetId*: The subnetId option allows you to launch the ProActive nodes on EC2 instances, which will run into an existing subnet added to a specific Virtual Private Cloud.
        This is an optional property.
        More information regarding Amazon EC2 Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) available on https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/[AWS EC2 Virtual Private Cloud] and Amazon EC2 Subnet available on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html[AWS EC2 Virtual Private Cloud and Subnet]

-   *rmHostname*: The hostname or the public IP address of the Resource Manager.
        This address needs to be accessible from the AWS cloud.
        For example, `try.activeeon.com`.

-   *connectorIaasURL*: Connector-iaas is a ProActive service used to interact with IaaS like AWS.
        By default it runs on the following URL _rmHostname/connector-iaas_.
        For example, `\http://try.activeeon.com:8080/connector-iaas`.

-   *nodeJarURL*: The full URL path of the _node.jar_ to download the ProActive node.jar on each new created AWS instance.
        The URL needs to be accessible from the AWS cloud.
        For example, `try.activeeon.com/rest/node.jar`.

-   *additionalProperties*: Additional Java command properties to be added when starting each ProActive node JVM in AWS instances (e.g. `-Dpropertyna
me=propertyvalue`). This is an optional property.

-   *nodeTimeout*: The estimated startup time of the nodes (expressed in millisecond). After this timeout expired, the node will be considered as lost.

Using this configuration, you can start a ProActive Resource Manager and Scheduler using the */bin/proactive-server* script.
An AWS EC2 NodeSource can now be added using the *Create Node Source* panel in the Resource Manager Portal or the command line interface:

    $ PROACTIVE_HOME/bin/proactive-client --createns ec2 -infrastructure org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.AWSEC2Infrastructure awsKey awsSecretKey numberOfInstances numberOfNodesPerInstance image vmUsername vmKeyPairName vmPrivateKey ram cores securityGroupIds subnetId rmHostname connectorIaasURL nodeJarURL additionalProperties nodeTimeout

As AWS is a paying service, when the ProActive server is stopped normally (without removing the created infrastructure), all the created AWS instances will be terminated. When the ProActive server is restarted, these instances will be re-configured as per the previous settings.

WARNING: If ProActive server is forcibly killed, the created AWS instances will not be terminated. And, when ProActive server is restarted, the infrastructure will be re-configured as per the previous settings. If the instances were deleted at the AWS side, they will be re-created and re-configured.


==== AWS Autoscaling Infrastructure

*Full name:* `org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.AwsAutoScalingInfrastructure`

Similarly to the EC2 Infrastructure, the *AWS Autoscaling Infrastructure* operates AWS EC2 service to provide computing nodes to the Resource Manager.
However, it implements a different instance management strategy that reduces the delay of node acquisition and node removal process and facilitates inter-node collaboration in the same cluster, thanks to the following changes:

	1. The instances operating the nodes are allocated from a common instance template.

	2. The nodes share the same networking infrastructure through a common Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
 The infrastructure supports networking autoconfiguration if no parameter is supplied.

===== Pre-Requisites

The configuration of the AWS Autoscaling infrastructure is subjected to several requirements.

	1. The administrator needs both an *AWS access key* and an *AWS secret access key* to enable ProActive to authenticate against AWS.
 Please refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#Using_CreateAccessKey[the AWS documentation] to learn how to get them.

	2. The *AWS region* that will support the node cluster must not have reached its resources quota.
 It has to be able to allocate one instance template in every case situation.
 If the network autoconfiguration has to be be triggered, the region has to be able to provide one VPC, one subnet, one internet gateway and one security group.
 The number of maximum allocated instances is to be configured by the administrator, but has also to comply with the limitation of the regions.
 Detailed information is available in AWS documentation for https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_vpc[VPC] and https://aws.amazon.com/fr/ec2/faqs/#How_many_instances_can_I_run_in_Amazon_EC2[Instances]. 

	3. The administrator must be in possession of a valid *AWS keypair* and the ID of the *Amazon Machine Image (AMI)* to provision instances operating ProActive node.
 If the AMI to use does not propose the Linux operating system, the administrator must supply a *provision script* to (i) download a Java Runtime Environment (JRE), (ii) download ProActive Node agent (node.jar), (iii) and start up the ProActive agent.

	4. Optionally, if networking autoconfiguration is not triggered, the administrator has to configure (i) a public *VPC*, (ii) a *Subnet* complying with with VPC CIDR configuration, (iii) an Internet gateway for that VPC and a (iv) Security Group authorizing HTTPS connection to Internet and PNP or PAMR connection to the Resource Manager.
 The administrator must be in possession of the IDs of the VPC, of the Subnet and of the Security Group.

	5. The Resource Manager has to be accessible from the AWS cloud.
 Please consider replacing PNP by PAMR as communication protocol if the Resource Manager is located behind a NAT gateway.
 You can get additional information about the PAMR protocol in the section <<_installation_on_a_cluster_with_firewall>>.

===== Infrastructure Configuration

To use a cluster of AWS instances as a computing resource for the ProActive scheduler, the administrator has to create a NodeSource in the Resource Manager with the *AwsAutoScalingInfrastructure* profile.
The configuration form exposes the following fields:

	- *vmGroupTagPrefix:* Each instance prepared by the connector is flagged with the tag named *vmGroupName*.
 This tag is valued with this configuration option and the Node Source name.
 Concurrent ProActive schedulers can therefore operate concurrent clusters in the same AWS region, with the same node source name, provided that they diverge on the affected value to this parameter.
 This option is mandatory.

	- *awsKey:* This field must be filled with the content of the AWS key from the administrator.
 This option is mandatory.

	- *awsSecretKey:* The administrator must complete this field with the content of their secret access key.
 This option is mandatory.

	- *maxVms:* This parameter defines the number of maximum tolerated instances on the infrastructure: the instance allocations will be systematically blocked if the Resource Manager tries to overpass this threshold. 
 This option is mandatory and cannot exceed 100.

	- *defaultInstanceType:* This parameter defines the instance type to use for AWS instance operating ProActive.
 This parameter should be choosen according to the expected processing to be performed on the node source. 
 This option is mandatory and has to be filled after one AWS InstanceType name (e.g. t3.large).

	- *amiId:* The administrator defines in this field the ID of the AMI to use to bootstrap instance operating ProActive nodes. 
 This option is mandatory, has to refer to an existing AMI in the region, and has to comply with AMI ID format.

	- *publicSshKey:* The administrator has to provide the name of the AWS keypair to be use to operate the instance supporting nodes.
 This option is mandatory, and must refer to an existing AWS keypair in the region.

	- *defaultVpcId:* This parameter can be filled with the ID of the VPC to use to operate instance operating nodes.
 If specified, this parameter has to refer to an existing VPC in the region and comply with the VPC ID format. 
 If left blank, the connector will trigger networking autoconfiguration.

	- *defaultSubNetId:* The administrator can define which subnet has to be attached to the the instance supporting nodes.
 If specified, this parameter has to refer to an existing subnet in the region affected to the specified VPC, and has to comply with the subnet ID format.
 This parameter has to be filled only if the *defaultVpcId* is also completed.
 Otherwise, this parameter has to be left blank to trigger networking autoconfiguration.

+
WARNING: Please do not trigger networking autoconfiguration if you operate ProActive on AWS with PNP protocol.
Otherwise, a new and distinct VPC will be used to operate the nodes created by the NodeSource, preventing their communication with the Resource Manager.

	- *defaultSecurityGroup:* This parameter receives the ID of the security group to spawn instances into.
 If this parameter does not meet the requirement regarding the providing the provided VPC and subnet, a new security group will be generated.
 This parameter is mandatory, and has to comply with the format of the ID of the AWS security groups.

	- *region:* The administrator specifies here the AWS region to allocate the cluster into.
 This parameter is mandatory and has to be configured after the name of an AWS region.
 Please see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions[the related documentation] to see the available region names.

	- *rmUrl:* This field receives the URL to access the Resource Manager from the nodes.
 The URL must comply with the specification of the communication protocols used by ProActive, and can therefore be prefixed with *pnp://*, *pnps://* or *pamr://*.
 This parameter is mandatory.

	- *rmHostname:* This field is to be filled with the domain name or the IP of the host operating the Resource Manager.
 This option is mandatory.

	- *externalStartupScript:* The administrator has to provide a script to configure AWS instances to work with ProActive.
 Usually, if not provided by the AMI, this script is expected to download the Java Runtime Environment and ProActive node.jar agent file.
 This field is expected to contain the content of the script, and start with a Shebang, as an AWS imposes it.
 If left blank, the script is automatically generated for the Linux OS.

	- *maxNodePerVM:* The administrator specifies the amount of nodes to be deployed on each AWS instance.
 This parameter is mandatory, and has to be an integer equal or greater than one.

+
WARNING: Please ensure this parameter is aligned with the capacity of the specified instance type mentioned in the *defaultInstanceType* field.

	- *deploymentTimeOut:* This field contains the delay in seconds for a node to be deployed and to contact back the Resource Manager before being declared as lost.
 This parameter is mandatory.

	- *cleanDelay:*	The administrator can define the periodicity in seconds for unused instance removal.
 This parameter is mandatory.

Using this configuration, you can start a Resource Manager and a Scheduler using the */bin/proactive-server* script  as explained in section <<_run_the_proactive_scheduler>>.
An AWS Autoscaling NodeSource can now be added using the *Create Node Source* panel in the Resource Manager or the command line interface:

    $ PROACTIVE_HOME/bin/proactive-client --createns awsAutoScaling -infrastructure org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.AwsAutoscalingInfrastructure vmGroupTagPrefix awsKey awsSecretKey maxVms defaultInstanceType amiId publicSshKey defaultVpcId defaultSubNetId defaultSecurityGroup region rmUrl rmCredential rmHostname externalStartupScript maxNodePerVM deploymentTimeOut cleanDelay

WARNING: When ProActive server is stopped (without removing the created infrastructure), AWS instances will not be terminated. And when ProActive server is restarted, the infrastructure will be re-configured as per the previous settings. If the instances were deleted at the cloud side, they will be re-created and re-configured.

 
==== OpenStack Infrastructure

*Full name:* `org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.OpenstackInfrastructure`

To use OpenStack instances as computing nodes, a specific OpenStack Infrastructure
can be created using the Resource Manager. This section describes briefly how to make it.

1.  First, you need to have an admin account on your OpenStack server. For more information see
https://docs.openstack.org/icehouse/install-guide/install/yum/content/keystone-users.html[OpenStack users and tenants].

2. The creation of OpenStack Infrastructure asks for an authentication to the OpenStack server and a deployment of instances that will host ProActive nodes.

Use the proper admin username and password to fill in the properties *username* and *password* and perform the basic OpenStack authentication. Those two parameters should never change, except if you need for some reason to handle multiple OpenStack accounts.

For more information regarding OpenStack authentication mode see https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/identity/authentication.html[OpenStack authentication mode].
    

Other properties needed for the authentication are:

   -   *domain:* The name of the domain to use that refers to the collection of projects and users defining administrative boundaries for managing Identity entities. For more information see https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/identity/domains.html[OpenStack domain].


   -   *endpoint:* The hostname or the IP address of the OpenStack server. This address needs to be accessible from the Resource Manager.
    

   -   *scopePrefix:* The scope prefix to use. It can be project, projectId, domain or domainId.


   -   *scopeValue:* The value of the scope prefix. 


   -   *region:* The Region for networks and compute resources to use.


   -   *identityVersion:* The REST API version of OpenStack installation. For more information see https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/pike/contributor/http-api.html[OpenStack API Version]. 

Properties needed for the deployment of instance are:

   -   *image:* Defines which image will be used to create the OpenStack instance. The value to provide is the unique image Id.
   
   -   *flavor:* Defines the size of the instance. The value to provide is the flavor name or the flavor Id. For more information see https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ops/content/flavors.html[OpenStack flavors].
    
    -   *publicKeyName:* Defines the name of the public key to use for a remote connection when the instance is created.
    
+
WARNING: In order to use publicKeyName, the key pair needs to be created and imported first on the OpenStack server. For more information see https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/cli/command-objects/keypair.html[OpenStack key pair management].
+
 
        
    -   *numberOfInstances:* Total number of OpenStack instances to create for this infrastructure.
    
    -   *numberOfNodesPerInstance:* Total number of ProActive Nodes to deploy in each OpenStack created instance.
    
+
TIP: If all the nodes of an OpenStack instance are removed, the instance will be terminated.
+


Other properties for the node deployment in the *Create OpenStack Node Source* are:

    -   *connectorIaasURL:* Connector-iaas is a ProActive service used to interact with IaaS like OpenStack. By default it runs on the following URL *rmHostname/connector-iaas*.

    -   *rmHostname:* The hostname or the public IP address of the Resource Manager. This address needs to be accessible from the OpenStack server.

    -   *downloadCommand:* The command to download the ProActive *node.jar*. This command is executed in all the newly created OpenStack instances.
    	The full URL path of the *node.jar* to download needs to be accessible from the OpenStack cloud.

    	    	
    -   *additionalProperties:* Additional Java command properties to be added when starting each ProActive node JVM in OpenStack instances (e.g. \"-Dpropertyname=propertyvalue\").
    

Using this configuration, you can start a Resource Manager and a
Scheduler using the */bin/proactive-server* script. An OpenStack NodeSource can
now be added using the *Create Node Source* panel in the Resource Manager or the command line interface:

    $ PROACTIVE_HOME/bin/proactive-client --createns openstack -infrastructure org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.OpenStackInfrastructure username password endpoint rmHostname connectorIaasURL image flavor publicKeyName numberOfInstances numberOfNodesPerInstance downloadCommand additionalProperties


WARNING: When ProActive server is stopped (without removing the created infrastructure), OpenStack instances will not be terminated. And when ProActive server is restarted, the infrastrucutre will be re-configured as per the previous settings. If the instances were deleted at the OpenStack Cloud side, they will be re-created and re-configured.



==== VMware Infrastructure

*Full name:* `org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.VMWareInfrastructure`

To use VMware instances as computing nodes, a specific VMware Infrastructure
can be created using the Resource Manager. This section describes briefly how to make it.

1.  First, you need to have an admin account on your VMware server.For more information see
https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-51/topic/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-670B9B8C-3810-4790-AC83-57142A9FE16F.html[VMware users].

2.  Use the login and password information to fill in the properties *vmware_username*,
    *vmware_password* in the *Create Node Source* panel located in the Resource Manager.
    Those two parameters should never change, except if you need for
    some reason to handle multiple VMware accounts. Other properties in the
    *Create Node Source* are:
    
    -   *endpoint:* The hostname or the IP address of the VMware server. This address needs to be accessible from the Resource Manager.
    
    -   *rmHostname:* The hostname or the public IP address of the Resource Manager. This address needs to be accessible from the VMware server.
    
    -   *connectorIaasURL:* Connector-iaas is a service embedded in the Scheduler used to interact with IaaS like VMware. By default it runs on the following URL *rmHostname/connector-iaas*.

    -   *image:* Defines which image will be used to create the VMware instance. The
        value to provide is the VMware folder together with the unique image Id, for example: `ActiveEon/ubuntu`.
        
    -   *minRam:* The minimum required amount of RAM expressed in Mega Bytes for each VMware instance that needs to be created.
    
    -   *minCores:* The minimum required amount of virtual cores for each VMware instance that needs to be created.
    
+
WARNING: If the combination between RAM and CORES does not match any existing VMware instance type, then the closest to the specified parameters will be selected.
+

    -   *vmUsername:* Defines the username to log in the instance when it is created.
    
    -   *vmPassword:* Defines the password to log in the instance when it is created.
    
+
WARNING: The username and password are related to the image.
+
        
    -   *numberOfInstances:* Total number of VMware instances to create for this infrastructure.
    
    -   *numberOfNodesPerInstance:* Total number of ProActive Nodes to deploy in each VMware created instance.
    
+
TIP: If all the nodes of an VMware instance are removed, the instance will be terminated.
+

       
    -   *downloadCommand:* The command to download the ProActive *node.jar*. This command is executed in all the newly created VMware instances.
    	The full URL path of the *node.jar* to download, needs to be accessible from the VMware cloud.
    	    	
    -   *additionalProperties:* Additional Java command properties to be added when starting each ProActive node JVM in VMware instances (e.g. \"-Dpropertyname=propertyvalue\").
    

Using this configuration, you can start a Resource Manager and a
Scheduler using the */bin/proactive-server* script. An VMware NodeSource can
now be added using the *Create Node Source* panel in the Resource Manager or the command line interface:

    $ PROACTIVE_HOME/bin/proactive-client --createns vmware -infrastructure org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.VmwareInfrastructure username password endpoint rmHostname connectorIaasURL image ram cores vmusername vmpassword numberOfInstances numberOfNodesPerInstance downloadCommand additionalProperties


WARNING: When ProActive server is stopped (without removing the created infrastructure), VMware instances will not be terminated. And when ProActive server is restarted, the infrastrucutre will be re-configured as per the previous settings. If the instances were deleted at the VMware server side, they will be re-created and re-configured.

==== GCE Infrastructure

*Full name:* `org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.GCEInfrastructure`

Google Compute Engine, aka GCE, delivers virtual machines running on Google's infrastructure.
To use GCE virtual machines as computing nodes, a specific GCE Infrastructure needs to be created using the Resource Manager.

Using this configuration, you can start a Resource Manager and a Scheduler using the */bin/proactive-server* script.
A GoogleComputeEngine NodeSource can now be added using the *Create Node Source* panel in the Resource Manager or the command line interface:

    $ PROACTIVE_HOME/bin/proactive-client --createns googlecomputeengine -infrastructure org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.GCEInfrastructure gceCredential totalNumberOfInstances numberOfNodesPerInstance vmUsername vmPublicKey vmPrivateKey image region ram cores rmHostname connectorIaasURL nodeJarURL additionalProperties nodeTimeout

WARNING: When ProActive server is stopped, GoogleComputeEngine instances will be automatically deleted. And when ProActive server is restarted, the infrastructure will be recovered as per the previous settings. The required GoogleComputeEngine instances will be re-created and re-configured.

==== Azure Infrastructure

*Full name:* `org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.AzureInfrastructure`

The Resource Manager allows to deploy ProActive nodes on the Microsoft Azure cloud. This infrastructure will create and manage virtual machines (VMs) with your custom Azure image and host ProActive nodes on them. In this section we will guide you through the requirements and configuration needed to setup an Azure infrastructure.

===== Pre-Requisites

To create an Azure infrastructure, ProActive relies on an existing Azure user account with a valid subscription. In particular, you will require:

- *Azure account:* You should have a valid Azure account, linked to an Azure subscription with enough budget and core quota to deploy the VMs (and their underlying resources) that you request.
- *Azure privileges:* If your account does not have full Admin privileges on your subscription, please make sure you have rights to:
* Access a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups[resource group] of your choice.
* Create VMs in that resource group.
* Delete VMs in that resource group.
- *Service Principal credentials:* ProActive uses Azure's API to manage the VMs in the infrastructure. This API requires a set of Active Directory _service principal credentials_ for non interactive login (client, secret, tenant). If you do not have them, you can create them via the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal[Azure Portal] or https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest[Azure CLI]. Please ask your administrator in case you do not have the privileges to create them. The credentials should be strings of hexadecimal values like _1a2b3c4d-5e6f-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-1a2b3c4d5e6f_.
- *Custom Azure +image+:* ProActive will create the infrastructure's VMs from an Azure image. You will need to have a custom Linux image available on the resource group of your choice. If you do not have one, you can create it by following https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-custom-images[this tutorial].

===== Infrastructure Configuration

Once all the pre-requisites are met, you are ready to create an Azure infrastructure. On the ProActive's Resource Manager portal, select _AzureInfrastructure_ from the Infrastructure drop-down list.

The following fields are available to configure your Azure infrastructure.

- *clientId:* Corresponds to the Service Principal _application ID_.

- *staticPublicIP:* A boolean flag to determine whether the public IPs of the infrastructure's VMs should be static. The default value is _true_.
- *additionalProperties:* Additional JVM properties to configure your ProActive node. The default values allow to handle both PNP and PAMR protocols. You can add your own properties but be aware that removing the current values might cause the deployment to fail.

The Azure infrastructure offers a simple interface to easily create ProActive nodes on Azure. If your project requires a dynamic and customizable set of Azure VMs, you can opt for an <<_azure_scale_set_infrastructure>>.

==== Azure Scale Set Infrastructure

*Full name:* `org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.AzureVMScaleSetInfrastructure`

We provide a highly customizable infrastructure to deploy ProActive nodes using an https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview[Azure Scale Set]. This infrastructure will allow you to automatically adjust the number of deployed virtual machines (VM) in response to the current workload, and according to your configured parameters, e.g. min/max number of nodes, number of nodes per VM, or minimal up-time. Auto-scaling will help you increase your processing capacity during peak computation periods, while keeping your expenses low during less intensive or idle periods.

Whether you require to run your workflows on Linux or Windows, use standard or custom VM images, do some pre-configuration steps, or mount a shared file system, the Azure Scale Set infrastructure can handle it. This guide describes the requirements and the various configuration parameters available to deploy an Azure Scale Set infrastructure.

===== Pre-Requisites

As in our standard <<_azure_infrastructure>>, ProActive relies on an existing Azure user account with a valid subscription in order to deploy a Scale Set. These are the specific requirements:

- *Azure account:* You should have a valid Azure account, linked to an Azure subscription with enough budget and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits[service quotas] to deploy the Scale Set that you request.
- *Azure privileges:* If your account does not have full Admin privileges on your subscription, please make sure you have rights to:
* Create a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups[resource group] in a region of your choice.
* Create a Scale Set in that resource group, and create its underlying resources: Public IP Address, Load Balancer, Network Security Group and Virtual Network.
* Create a Storage account in that resource group, and use its various services (in particular Blobs, Tables and Queues).
* Delete a resource group.
- *Service Principal credentials:* ProActive uses Azure's API to manage the Scale Set and Storage resources. This API requires a set of Active Directory _service principal credentials_ for non interactive login (client, secret, tenant). If you do not have them, you can create them via the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal[Azure Portal] or https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest[Azure CLI]. Please ask your administrator in case you do not have the privileges to create them. The credentials should be strings of hexadecimal values like _1a2b3c4d-5e6f-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-1a2b3c4d5e6f_.


===== Infrastructure Configuration

The Azure Scale Set Infrastructure offers a wide range of possibilities to configure your Scale Set so that:
[lowerroman]
. You have in your VMs everything you need to execute your jobs.
. You can control your expenses by defining size and limits of your VMs.

The available configuration parameters are:

- *azureCredentialFile:* Use the provided file selection tool to supply a file with your Azure Credentials. These credentials correspond to those generated with the Service Principal as mentioned in the Pre-Requisites sub-section. The file should be a four-line text document in a `.ini` like format, and must include the following elements:
+
....
client=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
key=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
tenant=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
subscription=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
....
Where:
+
* *_client_:* Corresponds to the Service Principal _application ID_.
* *_key_:* Corresponds to the _secret_ value (password) of the Service Principal.
* *_tenant_:* Corresponds to the Azure _domain_, _tenant ID_, or _directory ID_ of your Active Directory.
* *_subscription_:* Is the _ID_ of your Azure subscription.

+
You can opt to place this file in `$PROACTIVE_HOME/config/authentication/azure.creds` so that it will available and automatically loaded in case you want to have multiple Azure node sources.

- *maxVms:* Define the maximum number of VMs to be deployed by the scale set at any time. The number cannot exceed 100. The default value is _100_, so you might want to adjust this value according to your budget and expected processing peaks.
- *maxNodesPerVm:* Define the number of ProActive worker nodes to be deployed per VM. As a guideline, you might want to allocate one node per VM core, but you can set the number to better match your processing requirements. Default value is _2_.
- *machineType:* Define the type of Azure VM that you want to use for your Scale Set. You can use any size from Azure's Standard Tier, provided you have enough quota and budget to launch them. The default value is _Standard_D1_v2_, you should provide a valid type using a similar syntax (case insensitive). Azure provides an extensive list of VM sizes for https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes[Linux] and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes[Windows] VMs. If you want to know the available sizes for a specific region or subscription you can use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm?view=azure-cli-latest#az-vm-list-sizes[Azure CLI command] `az vm list-sizes -l {your location}`.
- *osType:* A choice between _linux_ and _windows_. Default value is _linux_.
- *Image:* There are four possible ways to specify the source image for your Scale Set VMs: _known images_, Azure Marketplace, Shared Image Gallery and Custom images. We describe each of them below.
* *Syntax summary*
** Known image: `MY_KNOWN_IMAGE`
** Marketplace: `marketplace#publisher:offer:sku[:version]`
** Shared Image Gallery: `gallery#resourceGroup:gallery:image[:version]`
** Custom image: `custom#resourceGroup:customImage`
* *_Known image._* Refers to commonly used images as defined in Azure's SDK. Accepted values are simple strings, as listed in the following table:

|===

* *_Azure Marketplace._* If you want to choose a particular image from Azure's Marketplace, use the prefix `marketplace#` plus the image's https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/cli-ps-findimage[URN] in the form `publisher:offer:sku[:version]`. Similarly to Azure CLI or PowerShell, ProActive allows you to specify a version of the image (with `:version`), or it will use the latest one if the version is omitted. Examples of valid inputs are: +
`marketplace#OpenLogic:CentOS:7.5` +
`marketplace#OpenLogic:CentOS:7.5:latest` +
`marketplace#credativ:Debian:8:8.0.201901221`
* *_Shared Image Gallery:_* The prefix `gallery#` allows you to use images from an existing Azure https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/shared-image-galleries[Shared Image Gallery]. Append the name of your Resource Group, your Gallery and your Image as `resourceGroup:gallery:image`. Optionally, you can specify a version too (`:version`); if no version is given, the latest image version will be used by ProActive. For example: +
`gallery#proactive-rg:activeeon-gallery:my-image` +
`gallery#myRG:myGallery:myImage:1.0`
* *_Custom Image:_* ProActive allows you to use a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-custom-images[custom image] to create Scale Sets. Use the prefix `custom#` followed by the resource group and the custom image name. For example: +
`custom#proactive-rg:custom-ubuntu`

- *sshPublicKey:* Optional parameter. In case of Linux, use it to provide a public RSA key to connect to your VMs via SSH. In case of Windows, use it to define a password to connect to your VMs via Remote Desktop. In both cases, the default user is _activeeon_. If the field is left blank a password will be automatically generated and written in the Scheduler log.
- *targetNetwork:* Optional parameter. Use it to define a specific Azure Virtual Network subnet for your Scale Set. If defined, the format should be _{resourceGroupName}:{network}:{subnet}_, e.g. _myGroup:myVNet:default_. If left unset, a new Virtual Network and subnet will be created inside the Resource Group.
- *azureRegion:* Defines the Azure region where the Resource Group and the Scale Set will be created. For the list of the regions supported by your subscription, you can use the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-account-list-locations[CLI command] `az account list-locations -o table`, the right name to use is the one in the column _name_. The region name should be in lowercase without spaces, e.g. for the region _West US 2_ use _westus2_. Default value is _westeurope_.
- *resourceGroupExistingName:*  Optional parameter. Defines the existing Resource Group name where only the Azure Scale Set and Storage Account should be created. This parameter should correspond to the existing Azure Resource Group in the specified *azureRegion*. +
 The Resource Group will be created with the Node Source unique name if the parameter *resourceGroupExistingName* is unset. +
 In case the parameter is set, several conditions have to be met:
 ** the deployment Scale Set template (to be specified in *armTemplateUrl*) should contain only a creation of next Azure resources inside Resource Group: the Scale Set and the Storage Account (no Azure Load Balancer, IP address, etc.)
 ** the target Azure Virtual Network should be provided by the user in the *targetNetwork* parameter.
- *rmUrl:* Optional parameter. Provide your server's URL or public IP (e.g. try.activeeon.com). If left unset, the default Resource Manager URL will be fetched from the system properties.
- *rmCredentials:* Optional parameter. Provide credentials to connect to the Resource Manager. If left blank, the credentials of the logged user will be used.
- *deploymentTimeout:* Delay before the Resource Manager can declare a deploying node as lost. To be set in _minutes_. You can set it to a reasonable time after which you expect the node to be running or marked as lost otherwise (e.g. _10_ minutes). Default value is _120_.
- *cleaningDelay:* Periodical cleaning delay, expressed in _seconds_. Every _X_ seconds the Resource Manager will remove from the Scale Set any VM that has been identified as idle. Default value is _60_. Note that setting a very short interval implies more frequent communication between the Resource Manager and Azure, which might impact on performance or responsiveness.
- *externalStorageAccount:* Optional parameter. Use it if you want to define a specific location of your ProActive node.jar worker; leave blank otherwise. If provided, the format should be: _{storageAccount}:{sas_key_token}[:has_node.jar]_.
- *linuxInternalCustomStartupScriptUrl:* If you are using Linux, provide a URL of a valid Linux bash script to configure your nodes. Otherwise, the parameter can be left empty.  We strongly recommend to use one of our default scripts listed below. You are free to copy the script and add custom steps, but be aware that any modification to the default script might cause the deployment to fail. Our startup scripts cover the minimum requirements to start ProActive; additional script engines like R can be installed through a _userCustomStartupScriptUrl_, where you can also add your custom configuration steps. +
+
Sample scripts (might require some customization for specific versions or OS):

* Debian 8 - `apt` based script, uses `systemd` for launching the node service. Default value.
+
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/activeeon-bot/1d4194fefff12cc9c5046c2455bd457b/raw
* CentOS 7 - `yum` based script, uses `systemd` for launching the node service.
+
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/activeeon-bot/c6f303c2c832fa40691874ef76484e92/raw
* CentOS 6 - `yum` based script, uses `init.d` for launching the node service.

- *userCustomStartupScriptUrl:* Optional parameter. Use it to provide a URL of a valid custom script (_.sh_ for Linux, _.ps1_ for Windows) that will be called at the VMs' startup. The script is called after the default ProActive configuration and before the node application is actually executed. You can use this script, for instance, to create directories, assign permissions, or download utilities. As a reference, we provide some sample user scripts:
* Debian: `apt` based script, includes installation of Python3, R, or SciLab.

[NOTE]
====
Note that this user custom script will be run as root/admin user.
====
- *nodePreCommand:* Optional parameter. This multi-line field can be used to provide specific commands to execute right before launching the ProActive's node.jar application. The main difference with the previous user custom script is that _nodePreCommand_ will be run as _the same_ user as node.jar. This field is thus useful for operations that require matching users, e.g. mounting a shared volume in Windows or creating non-root paths/files in Linux. Please note the OS-specific conditions for these commands:
* *_Linux:_* The commands will be appended as `ExecStartPre` lines to a _.service_ file. Therefore, commands should include their full path, e.g. `mkdir` should be written as `/bin/mkdir` or `chown` as `/bin/chown`.
* *_Windows:_* The commands will be included in a _.bat_ batch file and must therefore be DOS-compatible. As a guideline, here is an unofficial https://www.robvanderwoude.com/batchcommands.php[list of DOS commands] and a http://steve-jansen.github.io/guides/windows-batch-scripting/part-1-getting-started.html[scripting tutorial].
- *jvmParameters:* Add JVM parameters to configure your ProActive node, use the format _-Dproperty=value_. The default values allow for a correct deployment of the node. You can add your own parameters but be aware that removing the current values might cause the deployment to fail. A non-exhaustive list of node-related JVM parameters can be found in your configuration file `$PROACTIVE_HOME/config/network/node.ini`
- *armTemplateUrl:* Optional parameter, for advanced configuration only. This parameter is intended for users familiar with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authoring-templates[Azure Resource Management templates] willing to provide a custom resource configuration file. You should input a URL with a valid _.json_ ARM template. If set, this file will override https://gist.github.com/activeeon-bot/0ae94e182edfa6099314ad023d2d7bc4[ProActive's default ARM file].

As you can see, these parameters provide a lot of flexibility to configure your infrastructure. When creating your Azure Scale Set node source, the infrastructure should be coupled with a Dynamic Policy. This Policy will additionally define scalability parameters such as limits on the number of deployed nodes or the minimum idle time before a node can be deleted (to optimize node utilization).

==== Load Sharing Facility (LSF) Infrastructure

*Full name:* `org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.LSFInfrastructure`

This infrastructure knows how to acquire nodes from LSF by submitting a
corresponding job. It will be submitted through SSH from the RM to the
LSF server. This is the static version of the LSF infrastructure, for a more dynamic mechanism, as described in <<_deploy_via_other_schedulers>>, use the <<_native_scheduler_infrastructure>> instead.

    $ PROACTIVE_HOME/bin/proactive-client --createns lsf -infrastructure org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.LSFInfrastructure javaPath SSHOptions schedulingPath javaOptions maxNodes nodeTimeout LSFServer RMCredentialsPath bsubOptions

where:

-   **javaPath** - path to the java executable on the remote hosts (ie
  the LSF slaves).

-   **sshOptions** - Options you can pass to the SSHClient executable (
  -l inria to specify the user for instance )

-   **schedulingPath** - path to the Scheduling/RM installation
  directory on the remote hosts.

-   **javaOptions** - Java options appended to the command used to start
  the node on the remote host.

-   **maxNodes** - maximum number of nodes this infrastructure can
  simultaneously hold from the LSF server. That is useful considering
  that LSF does not provide a mechanism to evaluate the number of
  currently available or idle cores on the cluster. This can result to
  asking more resources than physically available, and waiting for the
  resources to come up for a very long time as the request would be
  queued until satisfiable.

-   **nodeTimeOut** - The estimated startup time of the nodes (expressed in millisecond). After this timeout expired, the node will be considered as lost.

-   **serverName** - URL of the LSF server, which is responsible for
  acquiring LSF nodes. This server will be contacted by the Resource
  Manager through an SSH connection.

-   **rmCredentialsPath** - Encrypted credentials file, as created by
  the create-cred[.bat] utility. These credentials will be used by the
  nodes to authenticate on the Resource Manager.

-   **submitJobOpt** - Options for the bsub command client when
  acquiring nodes on the LSF master. Default value should be enough in
  most cases, if not, refer to the documentation of the LSF cluster.

==== Portable Batch System (PBS) Infrastructure

*Full name:* `org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.PBSInfrastructure`

This infrastructure knows how to acquire nodes from PBS (i.e. Torque) by
submitting a corresponding job. It will be submitted through SSH from
the RM to the PBS server. This is the static version of the PBS infrastructure, for a more dynamic mechanism, as described in <<_deploy_via_other_schedulers>>, use the <<_native_scheduler_infrastructure>> instead.

    $ PROACTIVE_HOME/bin/proactive-client --createns pbs -infrastructure org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.PBSInfrastructure javaPath SSHOptions schedulingPath javaOptions maxNodes nodeTimeout PBSServer RMCredentialsPath qsubOptions

where:

-   **javaPath** - path to the java executable on the remote hosts (ie
    the PBS slaves).

-   **sshOptions** - Options you can pass to the SSHClient executable (
    -l inria to specify the user for instance )

-   **schedulingPath** - path to the Scheduling/RM installation
    directory on the remote hosts.

-   **javaOptions** - Java options appended to the command used to start
    the node on the remote host.

-   **maxNodes** - maximum number of nodes this infrastructure can
    simultaneously hold from the PBS server. That is useful considering
    that PBS does not provide a mechanism to evaluate the number of
    currently available or idle cores on the cluster. This can result to
    asking more resources than physically available, and waiting for the
    resources to come up for a very long time as the request would be
    queued until satisfiable.

-   **nodeTimeOut** - The estimated startup time of the nodes (expressed in millisecond). After this timeout expired, the node will be considered as lost.

-   **serverName** - URL of the PBS server, which is responsible for
    acquiring PBS nodes. This server will be contacted by the Resource
    Manager through an SSH connection.

-   **rmCredentialsPath** - Encrypted credentials file, as created by
    the create-cred[.bat] utility. These credentials will be used by the
    nodes to authenticate on the Resource Manager.

-   **submitJobOpt** - Options for the qsub command client when
    acquiring nodes on the PBS master. Default value should be enough in
    most cases, if not, refer to the documentation of the PBS cluster.


==== Generic Batch Job Infrastructure

*Full name:* `org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.GenericBatchJobInfrastructure`

*Generic Batch Job infrastructure* provides users with the capability to
add the support of new batch job scheduler by providing a class
extending
org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.BatchJobInfrastructure.

This is the static version of the Generic Batch Job infrastructure, for a more dynamic mechanism, as described in <<_deploy_via_other_schedulers>>, use the <<_native_scheduler_infrastructure>> instead (generic also).

Once you have written the implementation of the desired class, you can create a node source
which makes usage of this infrastructure by running the following
command:

    $ PROACTIVE_HOME/bin/proactive-client --createns pbs -infrastructure org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.GenericBatchJobInfrastructure javaPath SSHOptions schedulingPath javaOptions maxNodes nodeTimeout BatchJobServer RMCredentialsPath subOptions implementationClassName implementationFile

where:

-   **RMURL** - URL of the Resource Manager from the batch job scheduler
    nodes point of view - this is the URL the nodes will try to lookup
    when attempting to register to the RM after their creation.

-   **javaPath** - path to the java executable on the remote hosts (ie
    the slaves of the batch job scheduler).

-   **sshOptions** - Options you can pass to the SSHClient executable (
    -l inria to specify the user for instance )

-   **schedulingPath** - path to the Scheduling/RM installation
    directory on the remote hosts.

-   **javaOptions** - Java options appended to the command used to start
    the node on the remote host.

-   **maxNodes** - maximum number of nodes this infrastructure can
    simultaneously hold from the batch job scheduler server.

-   **nodeTimeOut** - The estimated startup time of the nodes (expressed in millisecond). After this timeout expired, the node will be considered as lost.

-   **serverName** - URL of the batch job scheduler server, which is
    responsible for acquiring nodes. This server will be contacted by
    the Resource Manager through an SSH connection.

-   **rmCredentialsPath** - Encrypted credentials file, as created by
    the create-cred[.bat] utility. These credentials will be used by the
    nodes to authenticate on the Resource Manager.

-   **submitJobOpt** - Options for the submit command client when
    acquiring nodes on the batch job scheduler master.

-   **implementationClassName** - Fully qualified name of the implementation
    of
    org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.BatchJobInfrastructure
    provided by the end user.

-   **implementationFile** - The absolute path of the implementation of
    org.ow2.proactive.resourcemanager.nodesource.infrastructure.BatchJobInfrastructure.

==== Native Scheduler Infrastructure

The Native Scheduler Infrastructure allows to interact with a <<_glossary_ns_native_scheduler,native scheduler>> to deploy ProActive Nodes.
This mechanism is described in <<_deploy_via_other_schedulers>>. This infrastructure must be associated with a <<_native_scheduler_policy>> and cannot be associated with any other policy.
The infrastructure parameters are described hereafter:

 * *RMCredentialsPath:* path to a file which contains the credentials of an administrator user which will own the node source. The ProActive Scheduler Server release contains two admin users credentials files: `config/authentication/rm.cred` and `config/authentication/admin_user.cred`
 * *NSFrontalHostAddress:* the host name or IP address of the cluster <<_glossary_head_node,head node>>.
 * *NSSchedulerHome:* the location of the shared ProActive installation on <<_glossary_ns_node,cluster nodes>> (cluster nodes must be able to access ProActive libraries in order to start ProActive Node). Example `/opt/proactive/activeeon_enterprise-node-linux-x64-8.1.0`.
 * *javaHome:* similarly, cluster nodes must be able to access the java command in order to start ProActive Nodes. ProActive installation includes a Java Runtime Environment under the `jre` subfolder. Example: `/opt/proactive/activeeon_enterprise-node-linux-x64-8.1.0/jre`.
 * *jvmParameters:* additional options which can be passed to the java command.
 * *sshOptions:* additional options which can be passed to the SSH command used to connect to connect to the host name or IP address specified in the NSFrontalHostAddress parameter.
 * *NSNodeTimeoutInSeconds:* timeout to wait for the deployment of ProActive Nodes on the cluster. As the time needed to deploy ProActive Nodes depends on the cluster load, this timeout should be a large value. If the timeout is reached, the ProActive Nodes will be in `"Lost"` <<_node_states,state>>.
 * *ìmpersonationMethod:* when a job is submitted to the native scheduler, the submission is performed under the current <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler_user,ProActive Scheduler user>>. An impersonation is thus performed between the <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler_process_user,scheduler server process>> and the target <<_glossary_cluster_user,cluster user>>.
 This impersonation can be performed using 3 different strategies:
 ** `ssh`: in that case the <<_glossary_head_node,head node>> is contacted using a SSH command with the current <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler_user,ProActive Scheduler user>> and password. User/password combination between the ProActive Scheduler and the head node operating system must match.
 ** `none`: in that case the head node is contacted using a SSH command with the <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler_process_user,ProActive Scheduler process user>> (passwordless SSH). Submission to the native scheduler will be performed with the same account.
 ** `sudo`: similar to `none` regarding the connection to the head node, but a `sudo` command will be initiated to impersonate as the current <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler_user,ProActive Scheduler user>>, before doing a job submission.
 * *alternateRMUrl:* the URL used by the ProActive Nodes to contact <<_glossary_resource_manager,ProActive Resource Manager>>. This URL is displayed on ProActive server startup. Example: `pnp://myserver:64738`.
 * *sshPort:* port used for SSH connections.
 * *nsPreCommand:* a Linux command which can be run before launching ProActive Nodes on the cluster. Can be used as a workaround when some system environment variables are not properly set when starting ProActive Nodes.
 * *nsSubmitCommand:* this is the main command used to start ProActive Nodes on the cluster. Depending on the actual native scheduler implementation, *nsSubmitCommand* will vary, here are examples definitions: +
+
[cols=2*]
|===

|PBS |`qsub -N %NS_JOBNAME% -o %LOG_FILE% -j oe %NS_BATCH%`

|SLURM |`sbatch -J %NS_JOBNAME% -o %LOG_FILE% %NS_BATCH%`

|LSF |`bsub -J %NS_JOBNAME% -o %LOG_FILE% -e %LOG_FILE% %NS_BATCH%`

|===
+
The command can use patterns which will be replaced dynamically by the ProActive Resource Manager. +
+
[cols=2*]
|===

|`%NS_JOBNAME%` |contains a configurable job name dynamically created by the resource manager.

|`%LOG_FILE%` |contains a log file path dynamically created by the resource manager and located in side the NSSchedulerHome installation. This log file is useful to debug errors during <<_glossary_ns_cluster_job,cluster job>> submission.

|`%PA_USERNAME%` |contains the current ProActive Scheduler user.

|`%NS_BATCH%` |contains the arguments defined inside workflow tasks using the NS_BATCH generic information.

|===

 * *nsKillCommand:* this is the command used to kill ProActive Nodes started previously by the nsSubmitCommand. Similarly to nsSubmitCommand, *nsKillCommand* will vary for each native scheduler syntax: +
+
[cols=2*]
|===

|PBS |`qdel %NS_JOBID%`

|SLURM |`scancel -n %NS_JOBNAME%`

|LSF |`bkill -J %NS_JOBNAME%`

|===
+
It can use the following patterns: +
+
[cols=2*]
|===

|`%NS_JOBNAME%` |contains a configurable job name dynamically created by the resource manager.

|`%NS_JOBID%` |contains the job id returned by the native scheduler when submitting the job. Currently, job id can only be used with PBS, when the setting `submitReturnsJobId` is set to `true`.

|===

 * *submitReturnsJobId:* is the <<_glossary_ns_cluster_jobid,cluster job id>> returned plainly when calling the nsSubmitCommand. This is the behavior of PBS, and this is why this setting should be set to `true` when using PBS.
 * *nsJobName:* a way to configure the `%NS_JOBNAME%` pattern. The following patterns can be used: +
+
[cols=2*]
|===

|`%PA_TASKID%` |contains the ProActive Task and Job ID associated with the node request.

|`%PA_USERNAME%` |contains the current ProActive Scheduler user.

|===

 * *maxDeploymentFailure:* number of attempts when starting a ProActive Node on the cluster using the nsSubmitCommand, after all attempts failed, the ProActive Node will be declared as `Lost`.
