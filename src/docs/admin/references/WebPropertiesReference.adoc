REST API Properties are read when ProActive Scheduler is started therefore you need to restart it
to apply changes.

The REST API documentation can be found at _SCHEDULER_URL/rest/doc_.

TIP: The REST API documentation for our try platform is available at https://try.activeeon.com/doc/rest/

TIP: The `PROACTIVE_HOME/tools/configure-http` command can be used to configure the main parameters of the web server such as the protocol (http/https) and port. See <<_configure_http_server_command>>.

The default configuration file is _SCHEDULER_HOME/web/settings.ini_.
