REST API Properties are read when ProActive Scheduler is started therefore you need to restart it
to apply changes.

The REST API documentation can be found at _SCHEDULER_URL/rest/doc_.

TIP: The REST API documentation for our try platform is available at https://try.activeeon.com/doc/rest/

The default configuration file is _SCHEDULER_HOME/web/settings.ini_.
