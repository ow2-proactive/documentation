==== Calendar Service
Calendar service is another ProActive micro-service allowing to visualize and manage (edit and delete) all jobs and planned jobs created by the user in a calendar client application such as Outlook, Thunderbird Lightning, Mac Calendar, etc. Be aware that calendar service could be started only when the ProActive scheduler is already running.

==== Installation

Python3 and Radicale are mandatory for calendar service's installation, as calendar service uses Radicale as CalDav server, and Radicale is written in pure Python.
For more information about Radicale, please refer to <http://radicale.org/>.

===== Windows
A portable Radicale program is available to be used in Windows environment, which includes all libraries and dependencies in one package to make Radicale server running on Windows.
    
    1. Run %PROACTIVE_HOME%\tools\radicale\windows\RadicalePortable_1.1.1_English.paf.exe and select a directory where the Radicale server will be installed (Note down this directory which is going to be used in the next step). 
+
WARNING: Do not tick the checkbox "Run Radicale Portable" in the last installation, Radicale server will be launched later after some configurations

    2. Add `RADICALE_HOME` system variable. Go to System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables, Click on the "New" button of the "System variables" section, set `RADICALE_HOME` as the variable name and the Radicale installed directory as the variable value
    
    3. Set up calendar service. Go to the \tools folder and run the calendar-service-setup batch script, the Radicale server will be started up by this script
    
+
[source]
----
cd  %PROACTIVE_HOME%\tools\
calendar-service-setup.bat
----

+
WARNING: At the end, the script will ask to run the calendar service or not, please don't run calendar service if ProActive Scheduler is not running.

        
===== Linux (Debian)
The following scripts have to be run as the same linux user as the one running proactive scheduler 

    1. Go to /tools folder, and run calendar-service-setup.sh batch script (which is going to install python3 and Radicale)
    
+
[source]
----
cd  $PROACTIVE_HOME/tools/
./calendar-service-setup.sh
----

+
WARNING: At the end, the script will ask to run the calendar service or not, please don't run calendar service if ProActive Scheduler is not running.


    2. Go to /tools folder, and run calendar-service.sh 
+
[source]
----
cd  $PROACTIVE_HOME/tools/
./calendar-service.sh start
----


===== Mac OS
Python3 has to be already installed on Mac OS. The user can follow the same steps for Linux to setup and start the calendar service.

==== Start up Calendar service

===== Windows
Go to the \tools folder and run calendar-service.bat

[source]
----
cd  %PROACTIVE_HOME%\tools\
calendar-service.bat
----

===== Linux
Go to the /tools folder and run calendar-service.sh

[source]
----
cd  $PROACTIVE_HOME/tools/
./calendar-service.sh start

----
TIP: `calendar-service.sh` can be used with option stop, restart, status as well.

==== Calendar service configuration

Some important configuration properties are shown in the list below

-  `server.port` - Calendar service rest server port, default value is "4242"

-  `pa.scheduler.rest.url` - ProActive scheduler rest url, which is used to subscribe to the scheduler's jobs events listener list. Default value is "http://localhost:8080/rest/"

-  `pa.scheduler.admin.login` - ProActive scheduler admin login name, used to connect to scheduler, default value is "admin"

-  `pa.scheduler.admin.password` - ProActive scheduler admin login password, default value is "admin"
