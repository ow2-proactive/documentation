*Product Name:* ServiceNow +
*Product Version:* Quebec +
*Compatibility:* Tokyo

==== Overview

The ServiceNow integration provides means to establish a bidirectional communication
between a ProActive server, and a ServiceNow instance.

==== Objectives

The goal is to provide templates and coding elements to help ServiceNow and ProActive users to easily integrate both solutions in their pipelines.

It boils down to: +

* Provide reusable code in ServiceNow to query ProActive's REST APIs.
* Provide workflows in ProActive's catalog to query ServiceNow's REST APIs.

==== Installation

This section describes the available processes to set up the required files in ServiceNow to communicate
with ProActive. The preferred installation process is dictated by the architecture of your application ecosystem
in ServiceNow. Either ProActive's integration will have a dedicated ServiceNow application, or it will be combined with an existing one.
ServiceNow being an application-based solution, the natural approach is to create a dedicated ProActive application.
If you want to incorporate this integration in another application that already exists, you will have to manually
create files in the host application, which means copying code blocks and ServiceNow files that will be presented in the next sections.

TIP: If the latter process is chosen, you can always install the ProActive application in a ServiceNow test instance to look at the
application's files and use them as templates as well as copy their code blocks.

===== Import from source control

Working from an online repository is the most convenient and durable way to proceed.
Importing an application from source control will result in a new application being created in this ServiceNow instance, based on the specified remote repository.
The account credentials you supply must have read access to the remote repository

. [.underline]#Lay down the Application#
    .. Fork the https://bitbucket.org/activeeon/proactive-application[Application's repository]
    .. Go to the Studio, under _System Applications_ -> _Studio_
+

    .. Click _Import from source control_
+
image::servicenow-import-from-source-control.png[align="center"]
    .. Click _Import_. When the application import is completed, click the _Select Application button_.
+
image::servicenow-imported-from-source-control.png[align="center"]
    .. In the Select Application dialog, click the link to the new application to open it for editing in Studio.

If you would like to customize the application, it is better to create a new branch and start working from there.

[start=2]
. [.underline]#Create a new branch#
.. In Studio, open the _Source Control_ menu and select the _Create Branch_ menu item.
+
image::servicenow-create-branch.png[align="center"]
.. Configure the branch.

    Branch Name: branchName
    Create from Tag: -- None --

.. Click the _Create Branch_ button.
.. Click the _Close_ button.

To load the application files included in the tag, return to the main ServiceNow browser tab (not Studio) and click the browser's reload button to refresh the page.

===== Upload an Update Set

Although it is not recommended by ServiceNow, you can download the following Update Set and import it into a ServiceNow instance
to create an application. An Update Set describes and contains all application's files and is specific to ServiceNow.

. link:../admin/references/servicenow/update_set_21813bcd2f9c91103c5d9facf699b605.xml[Download the Update Set].
. Go to _Retrieved Update Sets_ under _System Update Sets_
. Click on _Import Update Set from XML_
. Select the Update Set you just downloaded
. Click on _Upload_ and wait for the upload to complete

The Retrieved Update Set table should be displayed with the freshly uploaded file named _ProActive Workflows & Scheduling_

[start=6]
. Click on the Update Set Name to open it.
. Click on _Preview Update Set_ and wait for the preview to finish. +
This step is important as it compares an update set retrieved from a remote instance to
updates on the local instance to detect potential conflicts. You must preview an update set and address all problems before you can commit the update set.
. Once finished, click on _Close_
. Problems will appear because some tables and records don't exist in your instance and ServiceNow doesn't like that.
That's because we are installing an application and not updating it. We can ignore them and commit the changes.
.. Select all errors by clicking on the top left checkbox (this selects all the displayed errors)
.. Click on _Accept remote changes_ on the top right
+
image::servicenow-accept-remote-update.png[align="center"]
.. Repeat step a. and b. if errors remain
. Once all problems have been addressed, Click _Commit Update Set_
. Click Confirm data loss and wait for the commit to finish
. Once again, and for the same reason ServiceNow will inform us of errors
. Click on _Show Commit Log_ and check that all records are of "Info" status

Set a filter as shown and click on _Run_ to apply it.

Result should be empty.


==== Usage

Once the application is imported in your ServiceNow instances, you are ready to communication both ways between ProActive and ServiceNow.
