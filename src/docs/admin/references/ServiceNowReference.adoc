*Product Name:* ServiceNow +
*Product Version:* Quebec +
*Compatibility:* Tokyo

==== Overview

The ServiceNow integration provides means to establish a bidirectional communication
between a ProActive server, and a ServiceNow instance.

==== Objectives

The goal is to provide templates and coding elements to help ServiceNow and ProActive users to easily integrate both solutions in their pipelines.

It boils down to: +

* Provide reusable code in ServiceNow to query ProActive's REST APIs.
* Provide workflows in ProActive's catalog to query ServiceNow's REST APIs.

==== Installation

This section describes the available processes to set up the required files in ServiceNow to communicate
with ProActive. The preferred installation process is dictated by the architecture of your application ecosystem
in ServiceNow. Either ProActive's integration will have a dedicated ServiceNow application, or it will be combined with an existing one.
ServiceNow being an application-based solution, the natural approach is to create a dedicated ProActive application.
If you want to incorporate this integration in another application that already exists, you will have to manually
create files in the host application, which means copying code blocks and ServiceNow files that will be presented in the next sections.

TIP: If the latter process is chosen, you can always install the ProActive application in a ServiceNow test instance to look at the
application's files and use them as templates as well as copy their code blocks.

===== Import from source control

Working from an online repository is the most convenient and durable way to proceed.
Importing an application from source control will result in a new application being created in this ServiceNow instance, based on the specified remote repository.
The account credentials you supply must have read access to the remote repository

. [.underline]#Lay down the Application#
    .. Fork the https://bitbucket.org/activeeon/proactive-application[Application's repository]
    .. Go to the Studio, under _System Applications_ -> _Studio_
+
image::servicenow-studio-select.png[align="center"]
    .. Click _Import from source control_
+
image::servicenow-import-from-source-control.png[align="center"]
    .. Click _Import_. When the application import is completed, click the _Select Application button_.
+
image::servicenow-imported-from-source-control.png[align="center"]
    .. In the Select Application dialog, click the link to the new application to open it for editing in Studio.

If you would like to customize the application, it is better to create a new branch and start working from there.

[start=2]
. [.underline]#Create a new branch#
.. In Studio, open the _Source Control_ menu and select the _Create Branch_ menu item.
+
image::servicenow-create-branch.png[align="center"]
.. Configure the branch.

    Branch Name: branchName
    Create from Tag: -- None --

.. Click the _Create Branch_ button.
.. Click the _Close_ button.

To load the application files included in the tag, return to the main ServiceNow browser tab (not Studio) and click the browser's reload button to refresh the page.

===== Upload an Update Set

Although it is not recommended by ServiceNow, you can download the following Update Set and import it into a ServiceNow instance
to create an application. An Update Set describes and contains all application's files and is specific to ServiceNow.

. link:../admin/references/servicenow/update_set_21813bcd2f9c91103c5d9facf699b605.xml[Download the Update Set].
. Go to _Retrieved Update Sets_ under _System Update Sets_
. Click on _Import Update Set from XML_
. Select the Update Set you just downloaded
. Click on _Upload_ and wait for the upload to complete

The Retrieved Update Set table should be displayed with the freshly uploaded file named _ProActive Workflows & Scheduling_

[start=6]
. Click on the Update Set Name to open it.
. Click on _Preview Update Set_ and wait for the preview to finish. +
This step is important as it compares an update set retrieved from a remote instance to
updates on the local instance to detect potential conflicts. You must preview an update set and address all problems before you can commit the update set.
. Once finished, click on _Close_
. Problems will appear because some tables and records don't exist in your instance and ServiceNow doesn't like that.
That's because we are installing an application and not updating it. We can ignore them and commit the changes.
.. Select all errors by clicking on the top left checkbox (this selects all the displayed errors)
.. Click on _Accept remote changes_ on the top right
+
image::servicenow-accept-remote-update.png[align="center"]
.. Repeat step a. and b. if errors remain
. Once all problems have been addressed, Click _Commit Update Set_
. Click Confirm data loss and wait for the commit to finish
. Once again, and for the same reason ServiceNow will inform us of errors
. Click on _Show Commit Log_ and check that all records are of "Info" status

Set a filter as shown and click on _Run_ to apply it.

image::servicenow-search-by-status.png[align="center"]
Result should be empty.


==== Communicate with ProActive

Once the application is installed, you are ready to integrate ProActive in your ServiceNow pipelines.

We will go over the core application files in the application to explain how to use them.

===== Script Includes

====== Overview

As defined by ServiceNow, Script Includes are reusable server-side scripts logic that define a function or a class.
Script Includes execute their script logic only when explicitly called by other scripts anywhere in the application where scripting is permitted.

It can be in another Script Include, In Workflow Activities, Flow Actions, UI elements ...

====== Usage

Calling a Script Include where scripting is enabled is very easy. You just need to create an instance of the Script Include and execute its functions.

Here is an example where the Script Include named SchedulerClient is called in a Flow's Action to submit a job:

[[submit_from_catalog_script_code]]
[source,javascript]
----
(function execute(inputs, outputs) {

    var schedulerClient = new SchedulerClient();
    var response = schedulerClient.submitJobFromCatalog(inputs.proactive_url, inputs.session_id, inputs.bucket_name, inputs.workflow_name, inputs.variables, inputs.generic_info);

    outputs.job_id = response.id;
    outputs.readable_name = response.readableName;

})(inputs, outputs);
----

====== ProActive's application Script Includes

There are 3 script includes in the ProActive application:

*SchedulerClient*: A client that makes REST calls to a ProActive's Scheduler.
Call this Script Include to make HTTP requests to the Scheduler of a ProActive's server.

Here is the list of its current functions.

NOTE: Functions starting with an _ is a ServiceNow naming convention for private functions. This is purely informative
as in reality they are callable from anywhere like other functions.

*OutboundRestService*: A service class that contains a utility function to execute a ServiceNow's Outbound Rest Messages.
Used by the SchedulerClient, it encapsulates the procedure to build and execute an HTTP query to ProActive's Scheduler.

Like the SchedulerClient class, its function can be called from anywhere scripting is permitted.

*JobRepository*: It is the service class which holds functions to perform CRUD operations on the application's table labeled "Submitted job".
A table is a collection of records in the database. Each record corresponds to a row in a table, and each field on a record corresponds to a column on that table.
The Submitted Job table can be used to store Job Info data received from ProActive and access it in your pipelines.
Like other Script Include, it can be instantiated and called anywhere scripting is permitted.

You will find in the next section the structure of the table, which corresponds to JobInfo data fields returned by the Scheduler.

Here is the list of the current available functions

[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Function name | Action | Inputs | Output

| createSubmittedJob
| Adds a row to the Submitted Job table
a|
* sessionId: Session id of the ProActive user

===== Tables

The application has two tables that can be used to store and read data:

. *Submitted Job*: Each row contains data of a job submitted to the Scheduler.
This is the table used by the JobRepository Script Include to perform CRUD operations.
. *Workflow*: Each row contains a ProActive workflow xml definition file. The function submitJobFromFile of the SchedulerService Script Include
will search for the specified workflow's XML definition in this table.

Below you will find the structure of both tables

|Cell in column 4, row 3
|===

NOTE: All tables contain additional fields starting with sys_ . Those fields are automatically generated by ServiceNow when the table is created and can't be changed.

Two Table Columns have been added to the Incident table:

. ProActive Job Id
. ProActive Session Id

This allows to specify the sessionId of the user, and a job id at an Incident creation, binding it to a ProActive job.
Other columns can be added in the Incident table to store logs, outputs or any needed information regarding a job.

===== Flow Designer

Flow Designer is a feature for automating processes in a single design environment.

Actions and Core Actions are what composes a Flow and Subflow. The application comes with Actions ready to be used.
These Actions use the Script Includes that we described earlier.

An Action consists of:

- Inputs: Variables accessible from all steps of the action
- Action step(s): Process(es) using the provided inputs
- Outputs: Variables that represent the results of the action. These results are available to other actions in a flow.

ProActive's application Actions have been designed so that their inputs correspond to the related function called from
the Scheduler Client Script Include to make it as linear as possible.

.Available actions
[.center, cols="1", width=25%]
|===
|Action name

| Login to ProActive
| Disconnect from ProActive
| Submit job from catalog
| Submit job from file
| Wait for terminal status
| Disconnect from ProActive
|===

Here is an example with the "Submit From Catalog" action. It applies to other actions as well.

.Inputs of the Submit From Catalog action
image::servicenow-action-inputs.png[align="center"]

The Action inputs are accessible by all steps of the Action

Inputs of this step are bound to the Action inputs. This is represented by a pill
in the "Value" column.

.Inputs of the Submit From Catalog script step
image::servicenow-step-inputs.png[align="center"]

The action is composed of a single script step. A script step is JavaScript code to execute within a reusable action.
While most core actions and steps fit common use cases, a Script step enables to execute a behavior that is not satisfied by the core steps.

The code of this script step is displayed <<submit_from_catalog_script_code, here>>.

As you can see it is very simple and the execution flow consists of:

. Instantiating the SchedulerClient Script Include
. Calling the submitFromCatalog function with the inputs as parameters
. Writing the result in the outputs variable

Finally, we define the outputs of the action with the same pills system, binding them to the step outputs.

.Outputs of the Submit From Catalog Action
image::servicenow-action-outputs.png[align="center"]

The concept is the same for all the application's Actions.

===== Flows

To put it simply, a flow is an automated process consisting of a sequence of actions and a trigger.
Flow building takes place in the Flow Designer application which requires a paid subscription to the Integration Hub application.

A Flow consists of the content types:

- Subflows: A Subflow is an automated process consisting of a sequence of reusable actions and specific data inputs that allow the process to be started from a flow, subflow, or script.
- Actions: An Action is a reusable operation that enables process analysts to automate Now Platform features without having to write code
- Core Actions: A ServiceNow Core Action is a ServiceNow-provided action available to any flow that cannot be viewed or edited from the Action Designer design environment.
For example, the Ask for Approval action

A trigger identifies what causes the flow to execute. +

Flows are triggered by:

- Record creation and/or update
- Date
- Service Catalog request
- Inbound email
- Service Level Agreements
- MetricBase (requires the MetricBase plugin)

NOTE: To access Flows, a user must have the flow_designer or admin roles.

The ProActive application come with Flows that can:

- Submit a job from the catalog asynchronously
- Restart in error tasks

Below is the "Submit job from catalog async" Flow

image::servicenow-flow.png[align="center"]

This Flow submits a job to ProActive's Scheduler in parallel, thus not blocking the main Flow thread.

In the Right panel named Data, you will find the data flow of the Flow. It offers a quick view of the Flow variables, accessible by all actions
and the inputs for each Action. Fo convenience, it has been cut in half in this screenshot.

image::servicenow-data-flow-flow-designer.png[align="center"]

The flow needs a trigger definition, and it will ready to run.

===== Workflows

The second way to automate complex processes is using Workflows that are built in the Workflow Editor.
A Workflow is the native way to do automation in ServiceNow. Workflow editor is intended for a more technical audience.

The goal and concepts of Workflows are the same as Flows only with a different interface and terminology.

Like Actions for Flows, a Workflow is a suite of Activities used for automating the processes.
Activities are the workflow blocks that carry out various tasks like sending emails, obtaining approvals, running scripts, and configuring field values on the records.

Every workflow starts with a Begin activity and ends with an End activity.
When the activity ends, the activity is available through the suitable node and the transition is comprehended to the latter activity.

Following are the ways to launch Workflows:

- UI Action
- Server-side script
- Triggered by field values on a record

The ProActive application comes with a set of activities ready to be used in your workflows.
Like the Actions in the Flows, they call the application's Script Include to perform their actions.

Each activity likely have inputs that needs to be defined.

Here the Login activity will read variables defined in the workflow's scratchpad.

image::servicenow-activity-variables.png[align="center"]

This window automatically opens when the activity is dragged and dropped on the canvas.

Use ProActive's custom activities from the Custom tab to integrate ProActive in your pipelines.

Here an example of a simple Workflow, that can be stored and used as a Sub Workflow, that Submits a job to ProActive from the Catalog
