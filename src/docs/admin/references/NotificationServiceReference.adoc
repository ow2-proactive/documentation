[[_notification_housekeeping]]
==== Housekeeping

Notifications in the notification service have a global life span defined in the
application.properties located in
[[application-properties]] * `PROACTIVE_HOME/dist/war/notification-service/WEB-INF/classes/application.properties`
Past that time, they will be removed from the database.

Two parameters with default values may be updated:

1- The call frequency of the housekeeping defined by a CRON expression:
----
# This cron expression determines the housekeeping call frequency.
# Default value is 10 minutes: this will invoke the housekeeping mechanism
# to remove every notifications whose scheduled removal time is up.
notifications.housekeeping.cronexpression=*/10 * * * *
----
2- The life span of the notifications in seconds:
----
# Automatic remove notification delay (in seconds).
# The time at which notifications will be stored in the database
# Set this time to 0 if you don't want the notifications to be removed.
# Default value is 604800 seconds = 1 week
notifications.housekeeping.removedelay=604800
----

==== User parameter confirmation

Confirmation requests can be enabled for notification methods other than Portal in order to ask the
user to confirm the parameter he provided (Email address, phone number, etc).

For Email notification method, the user won't be able to activate it in his subscriptions before
the email is confirmed. However, Third-party notification method parameter is not mandatory and users
will still be able to activate the notification method before confirming it but the field that holds the parameter
inside the script will be empty.

To activate confirmation requests, go to the same application.properties file located
<<application-properties,*here*>> and set to true the properties:

* For Email confirmation

----
# Activate or deactivate email confirmation request to be used as recipient for notifications
mail.confirmation.enabled=
----

* For Third-party confirmation

----
# Activate or deactivate third-party confirmation request to be used as recipient for notifications
third-party.confirmation.enabled=
----

Confirmation requests have a life span of 15 minutes. Once that delay is passed, expired pending confirmations
are automatically removed by the housekeeping. Users will have to resend a new confirmation request in order to confirm
the parameter.

[[_email_notification_method]]
==== Email notification method configuration

The Email notification method uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol to send emails.
The notification service requires a valid SMTP configuration in order to send emails.
These settings are specified in the properties file located at:
 `PROACTIVE_HOME/dist/war/notification-service/WEB-INF/classes/email.properties`

All available SMTP properties are available at
https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/api/com/sun/mail/smtp/package-summary.html

By default Transport Layer Security is deactivated, change to true to activate it:
----
mail.smtp.starttls.enable=false
----
Authentication to the SMTP server is enabled by default.
----
mail.smtp.auth=true
----

Provide the server port used to connect
----
mail.smtp.port=
----

The credentials used to connect
----
mail.smtp.username=
mail.smtp.password=
----

The host of the SMTP server
----
mail.smtp.host=
----

A single email address is used by the notification service to broadcast emails.
It is defined in the application.properties file located at
`PROACTIVE_HOME/dist/war/notification-service/WEB-INF/classes/email.properties`
and is the email that will be displayed in the "From" field of the sent emails.
----
notification.email.from=
----

[[_third_party_notification_method]]
==== Third party notification method configuration

The <<_glossary_notification_third_party,*Third Party Notification*>> method executes a script when an event occurs.
There can be a single script execution, regardless of how many users are notified, or <<multiple-executions-mode, mutliple executions>>.

===== Script location
There are two ways to specify the location of the script.

* Using path: relative to the Scheduler or absolute

----
notification.script.path=dist/war/notification-service/WEB-INF/classes/exampleScript.sh
----

* Or a URL

----
notification.script.url=
----

WARNING: Note that to the `notification.script.url=` property will be used by the <<_glossary_notification_service,*Notification Service*>>
only if the `notification.script.path=` property is not provided. If provided the `notification.script.url=` property is ignored.
It means that the `notification.script.path=` property will always have the upper hand to indicated the location of the script to execute.

===== Script engine

An optional parameter can be provided to specify the engine to be used to execute the script
if not provided the extension of the file will determine the appropriate engine to use

----
#optional parameter for specifying Script Engine
notification.script.engine=bash
----

[[execution-mode]]
===== Execution modes
====== Single execution mode

By default Third party notification method is configured in single execution mode.
In single execution mode, only one script execution will occur for a given notification
regardless of how many users are notified.

For example if 5 users are subscribed to the Scheduler Frozen event with the Third party notification
method active then only one script execution will take place.

----
#if false execute the script one time per event even if there are several subscribers
#if true execute the script for each subscribers for each event
notification.script.multiple.execution=false
----

[[multiple-executions-mode]]
====== Multiple executions mode

To enable the multiple execution mode and access every notified users parameter inside the script, simply change to property to true.
This execution mode will trigger one execution for each notified user and, for each execution,
inject the user parameter in the script as an additional <<third-party-binding,Script binding>>.

For example, if 5 users are subscribed to the Scheduler Frozen event with the Third party notification
method active and multiple execution enabled, then each time the  <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler,*ProActive Scheduler*>> freezes
the script will be executed one time per notified user so, in this example 5 times.

===== Script bindings

[[notification-bindings]]
====== Notification bindings

Some relevant notification data is automatically passed to the script as bindings when executed.
It is simply needed to read the field as you would do with any other field in the used language.

In some cases, bindings might not have a value as it is not relevant.
For instance BUCKET_NAME, PROJECT_NAME, WORKFLOW_NAME are empty for Scheduler events
as they don't depend on job execution.

Example in groovy:
----
println "Reading the notification message: " + MESSAGE
----

Those bindings are passed to the script regardless of the selected <<execution-mode, execution mode>>

[[third-party-binding]]
====== Third-party parameters

When <<multiple-executions-mode,multiple execution mode>> is activated, an arguments array is passed to the script.
This array is accessible inside the script as a variable named `args[]` and it can contain two elements.

- The first parameter is defined in the User Settings and is global to all executions triggered by any of the user's subscriptions.

[title="Third-party user parameter input"]
image::notification-third-party-input.png[align="center"]

Example in groovy with only the User Settings parameter:
----
println "User parameter equals: " + args[0];
----

- The second parameter, is defined at the subscription level. It is only passed to the script execution triggered by the subscription it belongs to.

It will always be in second position.

[title="Subscription Third-party parameter"]
image::subscription-third-party-param.png[align="center"]

Example in groovy with the User Settings and the Subscription parameter:
----
println "User Settings parameter equals: " + args[0];
println "Subscription defined parameter: " + args[1];
----

====== Table of bindings

In the following table are specified all available fields that can be read in the script
and if they have a value depending on the event origin.

.Binding holds a value regarding event type (Y = Yes , N = No)

[[microsoft_teams_configuration]]
==== Microsoft Teams notification method

ProActive provides a ready to use Third-Party script that allows users to send notifications to Teams channels.

The script interacts with Microsoft Graph API to:

 - Connect as a user
 - Send a message to Teams channels

Some configuration must be done in ProActive and Microsoft beforehand but it consists in a nutshell of:

- Configuring the Notification Service to execute the correct script with the correct setup
- Create or use an existing Enterprise Application also noted App and retrieve informations from the Microsoft admin center. +
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=certificate[This Microsoft link] documents how to create an App and helps understand what it is.
- Provide these informations to the Third-Party script
- Update User Settings in the notification portal
- Add channel URLs to subscriptions

We will go into details on how to achieve this configuration now.

===== Configuring the notification service

All the following configuration takes place in the Notification Service's properties file located
----
PROACTIVE_INSTALL_FOLDER/dist/war/notification-service/WEB-INF/classes/application.properties
----

All the relevant properties are located at the end of the file. We will detail them now.

----
notification.script.path=dist/war/notification-service/WEB-INF/classes/microsoftTeamsMessage.groovy
# URL of the script, it will be processed if notification.script.path is empty
notification.script.url=
#optional parameter for specifying Script Engine
notification.script.engine=groovy
#if false execute the script one time per event even if there are several subscribers
#if true execute the script for each subscribers for each event
notification.script.multiple.execution=true
----

- *notification.script.path*: The notification service can execute a single Third-Party script, for all users. This property specifies the script that will be executed.
    It can't be dynamically updated and requires a server restart to be changed.
- *notification.script.url:* Allows specifying the script URL instead of using a path. Not used here.
- *notification.script.engine:* Specifies the engine used to execute the script. Here it must be set to groovy as we are executing a groovy script.
- *notification.script.multiple.execution:* Sets the execution mode to single or multiple execution. Explained <<execution-mode,here>>
    We will be using this script in multiple execution mode as we want each user to be able to send notifications using their microsoft accounts on different channels

Once the properties are updated as the code snippet above, you can save the file.

===== Configuring Microsoft 365
Because the script queries the Microsoft Graph API (a REST API) to interact with microsoft Teams, it needs to connect to Microsoft as a user (retrieve an authentication token) through a registered App. +
A registered App ensures secure communication with Microsoft Teams and allows for user-specific authentication.

This App is either already present or we can create a dedicated one for the ProActive Notification Service. +
Steps on how to create the App are present in the following description as well as in the Microsoft link provided at the <<microsoft_teams_configuration, beginning of this doc>>.

The Notification's Third-Party script needs 2 IDs and a secret, that are retrieved from the Microsoft Entra admin center:

- A *tenantId* -> The ID of your organisation
- A *clientId* -> The ID of the registered App
- A *secret* -> The "password", encoded using a ProActive tool, used to authenticate the app when querying the Graph API

====== Connect to the Microsoft entra center

- Connect to your Microsoft 365 account from https://account.microsoft.com/account/Account[here]
- Go to "My Apps" from the left menu

image::microsoft-my-apps-button.png[align="center"]

- Access the Admin center by clicking on the Admin app

image::microsoft-apps-dashboard-admin.png[align="center"]

- Access the Microsoft Entra admin center by clicking on "Identity" in the "Administration centers" left menu
//TODO get screenshot image::microsoft-apps-dashboard-Entra-admin-button.png[align="center"]
- Click on the "App Registration" sub menu in the "Applications" left menu

image::entra-admin-center.png[align="center"]

====== Create an App

- Click on the "New Registration" button

image::create-app-button.png[align="center"]

- Provide a name for the App. Here we use the name NotificationService.
- Leave the default Supported account type in single tenant
- Finally, click on the "Register" button

image::microsoft-entra-register-app.png[align="center"]

====== Copy the tenantId and clientID

- If you just created an App, you land on the App overview.
- If you use an existing App, click on "All applications" and click on your app

Copy and save the tenantId and clientId

image::microsoft-app-tenant-client-id.png[align="center"]

====== Give the app the necessary API permissions

The App needs to have the authorisation to Read Users and Send messages to channels as shown below

image::microsoft-app-api-permission.png[align="center"]

To add these permissions:

- From the App overview, click on the API permission left menu
- Click on the "Add Permission button"
- Click on "Microsoft Graph"

image::microsoft-app-graph-permission.png[align="center"]

- Click on "Delegated Permission" (because the authorization is delegated to users, not the app itself)
- In the search bar, enter ChannelMessage.Send, select the permission then click on "Add permission"

image::microsoft-add-permission.png[align="center"]

- Do the same for the permission User.Read
- Click on "Grant admin consent for ..."

image::microsoft-app-grant-admin-consent.png[align="center"]

====== Create a secret

To authenticate itself, the app uses a secret. It must be created on this portal.

WARNING: After the secret is created, it can be read and copied once. If lost, it is definitely lost and a new secret must be created, encoded, and replaced in the Third-Party script.
You can store the secret in a secure vault or encrypted file and you should also avoid sharing it in plain text to prevent unauthorized access.

- If not already there, go to "App registration" and select the App
- Click on the "Certificates & secrets" in the left menu
- Click on "New client secret"
- Provide a secret description and select an expiry date. +

A new secret will need to be created and provided to the script after this date.

IMPORTANT: Copy the secret value as it will be hidden right after. It will be encrypted in the next step.

image::microsoft-copy-secret.png[align="center"]

====== Encrypt the secret

The last step is to encrypt the secret as we don't want to provide it in plain text.
We will also do this for the Microsoft 365 user password.

An encryption tool is provided with ProActive and is located in
----
PROACTIVE_INSTALL_FOLDER/tools
----

To encrypt the data:
- Open a console an navigate to the tools folder of the ProActive installation
- Execute the encrypt script with the -d option and the data as argument.

Example:
----
encrypt -d J8o8Q~q1T54ExSZ262mjBc-zOifI3CfFwuS0GN5srcZN
----

The output is en encrypt String enclosed by the characters ENC()

Output example:
----
ENC(RLqBfho9KuD561d51d8zd62frDF511F5FA51650hPKJGo2p+8mWodQ9C3rF5OcdVg8ea1JrGg=)
----

Ensure the ENC() output is copied accurately, including the parentheses, as it is essential for the script to function properly.

===== Configuring the Third-Party script

Now that we created and/or configured the App, we need to configure the script. +
The data copied in the earlier steps is not user specific and needs to be provided directly in the script.

The script is in the same location as the properties file:
----
PROACTIVE_INSTALL_FOLDER/dist/war/notification-service/WEB-INF/classes/microsoftTeamsMessage.groovy
----

In this script you will find this code block, starting line 55

----
// ===== Azure Configuration =====
// The tenant ID (organization ID)
String tenantId=""
// Application ID (Client ID)
String clientId = ""
// The secret encrypted beforehand using the encrypt script found in PROACTIVE_INSTALL/tools
String encryptedSecret = ""; // <----- starting with ENC(....)
----

If not already done, the secret needs to be encrypted as explained in the earlier steps.

- Fill in the tenantId, the clientId and the encrypted secret. +
- Save the file.

===== Configuring the notification portal

The remaining configuration lies in the notification portal where we need to:

- Update User Settings
- Create or Update subscriptions

For detailed steps on updating user settings and managing subscriptions, refer to the ProActive User Guide, section <<../user/ProActiveUserGuide.adoc#microsoft_teams,Configure Microsoft Teams Messages>>.

[[slack_configuration]]
==== Slack notification method

ProActive provides a ready to use script to send Notifications to Slack channels using the Third-Party notification method.

There are two ways to use this script, depending on the selected <<execution-mode,Third-Party execution mode>>.

1. Single execution (default mode): In this mode a list of webhooks must be hardcoded in the script as there is a single script execution, without any user parameter. +
This means that all notification will be sent to the same channels, without the possibility to dynamically add of remove channels. +
In such mode, a User only needs to activate the Third-Party notification method of a subscription to start notifying the Slack channels.
2. Multi execution mode: Each notified user will trigger a script execution. +
This mode allows users to:
- Specify Slack webhooks in their User Settings. +
These webhooks will be notified by all user's script executions of all their subscriptions
- Specify Slack webhooks in each subscriptions Third-Party param. +
These webhooks will be injected in each execution triggered by the subscription they belong to.

Depending on the parameter mode set in the script, Subscriptions webhooks may override or be added to the ones provided the User Settings.

This is detailed further in this guide.

===== Configuring the notification service

In this set-up we will be using the multiple execution mode, as described <<execution-mode,here>> with the script set to *ADD* subscription provided webhooks to User Settings webhooks

===== Updating properties

First, lets update the Notification Service properties. The file is located:

----
PROACTIVE_INSTALL_FOLDER/dist/war/notification-service/WEB-INF/classes/application.properties
----

These 3 properties that need an update are located at the end of the file and needs to be set as follow:

----
notification.script.path=dist/war/notification-service/WEB-INF/classes/slackNotification.groovy
notification.script.engine=groovy
notification.script.multiple.execution=true
----

The ProActive server needs a restart when these properties are updated.

[[slack_configuration_script_mode]]
===== Script configuration

The Slack notification script can process User Settings and Subscriptions webhooks in two ways.

- *ADD*: In this mode, the script will merge the webhooks from the User Settings and the webhooks from the Subscription
- *OVERRIDE*: In this mode, webhooks from the Subscription replaces the ones from the User Settings, if provided.

By default, the script is in the ADD mode, which is the one we will use in our configuration.

===== Configuring the notification portal

The last configuration steps takes place in the notification portal and are detailed in <<../user/ProActiveUserGuide.adoc#slack_notifications,this section>> of the User Guide
