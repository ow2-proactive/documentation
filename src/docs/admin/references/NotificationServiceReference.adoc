[[_notification_housekeeping]]
==== Housekeeping

Notifications in the notification service have a global life span defined in the
application.properties located in
[[application-properties]] * `PROACTIVE_HOME/dist/war/notification-service/WEB-INF/classes/application.properties`
Past that time, they will be removed from the database.

Two parameters with default values may be updated:

1- The call frequency of the housekeeping defined by a CRON expression:
----
# This cron expression determines the housekeeping call frequency.
# Default value is 10 minutes: this will invoke the housekeeping mechanism
# to remove every notifications whose scheduled removal time is up.
notifications.housekeeping.cronexpression=*/10 * * * *
----
2- The life span of the notifications in seconds:
----
# Automatic remove notification delay (in seconds).
# The time at which notifications will be stored in the database
# Set this time to 0 if you don't want the notifications to be removed.
# Default value is 604800 seconds = 1 week
notifications.housekeeping.removedelay=604800
----

==== User parameter confirmation

Confirmation requests can be enabled for notification methods other than Portal in order to ask the
user to confirm the parameter he provided (Email address, phone number, etc).

For Email notification method, the user won't be able to activate it in his subscriptions before
the email is confirmed. However, Third-party notification method parameter is not mandatory and users
will still be able to activate the notification method before confirming it but the field that holds the parameter
inside the script will be empty.

To activate confirmation requests, go to the same application.properties file located
<<application-properties,*here*>> and set to true the properties:

* For Email confirmation

----
# Activate or deactivate email confirmation request to be used as recipient for notifications
mail.confirmation.enabled=
----

* For Third-party confirmation

----
# Activate or deactivate third-party confirmation request to be used as recipient for notifications
third-party.confirmation.enabled=
----

Confirmation requests have a life span of 15 minutes. Once that delay is passed, expired pending confirmations
are automatically removed by the housekeeping. Users will have to resend a new confirmation request in order to confirm
the parameter.

[[_email_notification_method]]
==== Email notification method configuration

The Email notification method uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol to send emails.
The notification service requires a valid SMTP configuration in order to send emails.
These settings are specified in the properties file located at:
 `PROACTIVE_HOME/dist/war/notification-service/WEB-INF/classes/email.properties`

By default Transport Layer Security is active, change to false to deactivate it:
----
mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
----
Authentication to the SMTP server is enabled by default.
----
mail.smtp.auth=true
----

Provide the server port used to connect
----
mail.smtp.port=
----

The credentials used to connect
----
mail.smtp.username=
mail.smtp.password=
----

The host of the SMTP server
----
mail.smtp.host=
----

A single email address is used by the notification service to broadcast emails.
It is defined in the application.properties file located at
`PROACTIVE_HOME/dist/war/notification-service/WEB-INF/classes/email.properties`
and is the email that will be displayed in the "From" field of the sent emails.
----
notification.email.from=
----

[[_third_party_notification_method]]
==== Third party notification method configuration

The <<_glossary_notification_third_party,*Third Party Notification*>> method executes a script when an event occurs.
There can be a single script execution, regardless of how many users are notified, or <<multiple-executions-mode, mutliple executions>>.

===== Script location
There are two ways to specify the location of the script.

* Using path: relative to the Scheduler or absolute

----
notification.script.path=dist/war/notification-service/WEB-INF/classes/exampleScript.sh
----

* Or a URL

----
notification.script.url=
----

WARNING: Note that to the `notification.script.url=` property will be used by the <<_glossary_notification_service,*Notification Service*>>
only if the `notification.script.path=` property is not provided. If provided the `notification.script.url=` property is ignored.
It means that the `notification.script.path=` property will always have the upper hand to indicated the location of the script to execute.

===== Script engine

An optional parameter can be provided to specify the engine to be used to execute the script
if not provided the extension of the file will determine the appropriate engine to use

----
#optional parameter for specifying Script Engine
notification.script.engine=bash
----

[[execution-mode]]
===== Execution modes
====== Single execution mode

By default Third party notification method is configured in single execution mode.
In single execution mode, only one script execution will occur for a given notification
regardless of how many users are notified.

For example if 5 users are subscribed to the Scheduler Frozen event with the Third party notification
method active then only one script execution will take place.

----
#if false execute the script one time per event even if there are several subscribers
#if true execute the script for each subscribers for each event
notification.script.multiple.execution=false
----

[[multiple-executions-mode]]
====== Multiple executions mode

To enable the multiple execution mode and access every notified users parameter inside the script, simply change to property to true.
This execution mode will trigger one execution for each notified user and, for each execution,
inject the user parameter in the script as an additional <<third-party-binding,Script binding>>.

For example, if 5 users are subscribed to the Scheduler Frozen event with the Third party notification
method active and multiple execution enabled, then each time the  <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler,*ProActive Scheduler*>> freezes
the script will be executed one time per notified user so, in this example 5 times.

===== Script bindings

[[notification-bindings]]
====== Notification bindings

Some relevant notification data is automatically passed to the script as bindings when executed.
It is simply needed to read the field as you would do with any other field in the used language.

In some cases, bindings might not have a value as it is not relevant.
For instance BUCKET_NAME, PROJECT_NAME, WORKFLOW_NAME are empty for Scheduler events
as they don't depend on job execution.

Example in groovy:
----
println "Reading the notification message: " + MESSAGE
----

Those bindings are passed to the script regardless of the selected <<execution-mode, execution mode>>

[[third-party-binding]]
====== Third-party user parameter binding

When <<multiple-executions-mode,multiple execution mode>> is activated, the user which is notified can add
an additional argument to the script. This letter parameter will be used inside the script as a new
binding named `args[]`.
To access the user parameter in the script, like for <<notification-bindings,notification bindings>>, simply read the array.

Example in groovy:
----
println "User parameter equals: " + args[0];
----

The image below shows where a user may provide a parameter in the notification-portal.

[title="Third-party user parameter input"]
image::notification-third-party-input.png[align="center"]

====== Table of bindings

In the following table are specified all available fields that can be read in the script
and if they have a value depending on the event origin.

.Binding holds a value regarding event type (Y = Yes , N = No)
