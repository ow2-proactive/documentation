== Run As Me
This is a step by step tutorial, which was tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and Microsoft Windows 7.

ProActive Workflows & Scheduling allows advanced user management with the *Run As Me* feature. Run as me allows
to execute a task under the current ProActive user, if an equally named system user exists on the executing machine.

=== Node configuration

The following steps configure the Node with a sample user called Gord.

==== Linux

. Create a group called activeeon: _groupadd activeeon_
. Create a user running the ProActive Node, set it's primary group to proactive: _useradd -g activeeon -G sudo -m proactive_
. Set the password of proactive user: _passwd proactive_
. Download and unzip ProActive inside the _/opt/_ directory (_/opt/_ gives execution right to everyone)
. Change ownership of the ProActive folder with _sudo chown -R proactive:activeeon ProActive_
. Add a *Run As Me* user, which needs to be part of the activeeon group _useradd -g activeeon -m Gord_
. Create an SSH key for the *Run As Me* user (Gord) _ssh-keygen -t rsa_
. Go into the _/home/Gord/.ssh_ directory and copy Gordâ€™s public key to the authorized keys _cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys_
. Log into the _activeeon_ account
. Start the ProActive Node with the property `-Dpas.launcher.forkas.method=key`

NOTE: The proactive user got a password set with _passwd proactive_ to execute the sudo command. Whereas the run as me user (Gord) got an SSH key set. If you wish, you can assign a password to Gord _passwd Gord_.


==== Windows

. Create an account called _proactive_:
+
In *Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Computer Management->Local Users and Groups*
+
image::add_user.png[align=center]
NOTE: The _proactive_ account might already exist if the ProActive Agent has been installed previously.
. Create an account Gord that will be used as the *Run As Me* account
. Create a group _activeeon_, and add all the previous accounts to this group.
+
In *Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Computer Management->Local Users and Groups*
+
image::add_group.png[align=center]
. Add privileges to log on locally for the accounts of the _activeeon_ group
.. Control Panel->Administrative tools->Local Security Policy->Local Policies->User Right Assignment
+
image::allow_log_on_locally.png[align=center]
.. On the policy _Allow log on locally_, click on _Edit properties_ and add the _activeeon_ group
. Create a temp directory (i.e _C:\tmp_)
. Start the proactive node using the `proactive` account:
----
runas.exe /noprofile /user:proactive "PROACTIVE_HOME/bin/proactive-node.bat -Dpas.launcher.forkas.method=pwd -Djava.io.tmpdir=<TMP_DIR> -Dpa.logs.dir=<TMP_DIR>"
----

NOTE: The proactive node is bundled in the ProActive Scheduler which is installed in the next section.

=== Scheduler configuration

The following steps configure the Scheduler with a sample user called Gord.

==== Linux

. Use the following command to create the Gord account in the scheduler:
+
----
tools/proactive-users -C -l Gord -p Gord -g admin
----
. Start the Scheduler
. Log in as Gord
. Add the private key of Gord in the Scheduler interface under _Manage third-party credentials_. Key: SSH_PRIVATE_KEY,
Credential: Content of Gords' private key, without the '_-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----_' and _-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----_ comments
. Create a task in the Studio and tick _Run as me_

NOTE: The ProActive Node must be installed in a directory where every parent directory gives execution rights to users, which
execute tasks.
The users need to be part of the proactive group because a task needs the rights to write logs. Which is achieved by
being part of the proactive group and the proactive group ownership of the ProActive Node directory.


==== Windows

. Install ProActive server by downloading and unzipping it to a convenient folder.
. Use the following command to create the Gord account in the scheduler:
+
----
tools/proactive-users -C -l Gord -p Gord -g admin
----
. Start the scheduler server: _PROACTIVE_HOME/bin/proactive-server.bat_
. Log in the Studio's web interface with the Gord username.
. Create a task and tick _Run as me_.
. Execute the job.
