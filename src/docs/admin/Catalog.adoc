The Catalog stores ProActive Objects and in particular ProActive Workflows through a REST API.
It is subdivided into buckets.
Each bucket has a unique name and stores zero, one or more versioned ProActive Objects.

By default, ProActive objects are persisted on disk using the embedded HSQL database.
The data is located in `PROACTIVE_HOME/data/db/catalog`.

The Catalog is a WAR file which contains a configuration file.
More information regarding the Catalog configuration can be found in <<_catalog_properties>>.


A complete documentation of the Catalog REST API is available by default on:
