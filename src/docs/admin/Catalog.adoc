The *ProActive Catalog* is a component responsible for storing various objects of *ProActive Workflows and Scheduling* and in particular *ProActive Workflows*.

The ProActive Catalog features:

 * +++a <a class="catalogRestUrl" href="/catalog" target="_blank">REST API</a>.+++
 * +++a comprehensive <a class="automationDashboardUrl" href="/automation-dashboard/#/portal/catalog-portal" target="_blank">Catalog Portal</a>.+++

ProActive Catalog is organized into *buckets*.
Each bucket has a unique name and stores zero, one or more versioned ProActive Objects.

By default, ProActive objects are persisted on disk using the embedded HSQL database.
The data is located in `PROACTIVE_HOME/data/db/catalog`.

The Catalog web service binaries are stored in `PROACTIVE_HOME/dist/war/catalog`.
This directory contains a configuration file located in `PROACTIVE_HOME/dist/war/catalog/WEB-INF/classes/application.properties`.

More information regarding the Catalog configuration can be found in the <<../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.adoc#_catalog_properties,catalog properties>> section.


A complete documentation of the Catalog REST API is available on the following +++<a class="catalogRestUrl" href="/catalog" target="_blank">link</a>+++.

This documentation is automatically generated using https://swagger.io[Swagger^].

==== Catalog security and groups management

The Catalog authenticates REST request using a *sessionID* header.
This sessionID is used to share session information between various ProActive Workflows & Scheduling microservices and is returned when authenticating to +++a <a class="restUrl" href="/rest" target="_blank">ProActive Scheduler REST API</a>.+++.

Every request to the Catalog must have a valid sessionID inside the request header to authenticate the user.
A role-based access control mechanism can also be defined on catalog buckets.
When creating a bucket, it can either be made *public* or restrained to a specific *group*.

Creating users and groups at the ProActive Scheduler level is explained in the <<../ProActiveAdminGuide.adoc#_user_authentication,User Authentication>> section.

A _public_ bucket is automatically assigned to the *public-objects* group.

For example, a user which is part of the _interns_ group (GROUP:interns) can see and change buckets and their contents which belong to GROUP:interns.
This user can only access to the following buckets list:

  * All buckets that the user created.
  * All buckets belonging to the _interns_ group (GROUP:interns).
  * All _public_ buckets (GROUP:public-objects).
